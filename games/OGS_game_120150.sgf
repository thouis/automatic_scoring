C[quiller: L3 is too close to b's wall now and b can pick and chose how he wants to use his massive influence
]
C[davos: Somehow I would not be satisfied with the result on the right if I were white. White lived in sente, but the black wall is very, very thick.
]
C[quiller: You are exactly right
]
;B[hp]
C[quiller: This doesn;t seem so good, simply L5 or J3 both seem better
]
C[davos: You may be right. I would prefer J3 over L5 though. L5 would let white get off the hook.
]
;W[hq]
C[davos: Unexpected, but I found it surprisingly difficult to handle this move. I felt slightly outplayed here.

C[davos: I envisioned this result when I played F3. Is it too slow for Black? I'm not sure.

C[quiller: It seems sort of wishy-washy in the end. I don't think L3 has been severly enough punished or your influence really exploited
]

C[quiller: I think E4 would pose w a difficult problem, this way w has it easy
]
C[davos: If black plays E4, wouldn't white just answer at D5 and say thank you?
]
C[quiller: I don't think so. b can make the two-step hane at d3 c2 and play ko relying on the ko threats on the right hand side to win. then w has very little to show for his 4-4 pt
]
;W[dm]
;B[cf]
;W[ch]
C[davos: Shouldn't white go for territory with C16? In the game, K16 is weakened and the left side is still not white territory.
]
C[quiller: No, I think it's ok to go for influence. W has G6 and follow-up moves against F3 w also has P5 and Q11 to aim at. After this joseki you felt compelled to make a bad invasion

C[quiller: I don't hink B should be aiming for this joseki. Something that builds influence would be better. If you're scared of the pincer then play C9 first before the joseki
]
C[davos: Actually, I felt lucky white chose the pincer joseki instead of just defending at C16, because in that case white would have more secure territory and no weaknesses. That way I would have been worried that my wall would become ineffective.
]
;B[ee]
;W[ef]
;B[ec]

;B[ck]
C[quiller: I don't think this is good. W has a weakness at D14 but this stone doesn't make good use of B's thickness - it sees to create a weak group
]
C[davos: You may be right, but My estimation was that This group would not die and white would then be lacking territory.
If black lets white make a big territory here, Black may end up lacking territory, because he won't be able to use his thickness for fighting.
]
C[quiller: I think you were lucky to get out of this with any value left from your early thickness. But you won, so your judgement may just be better than mine
]
C[davos: Your judgement may be better than mine here. I wouldn't know if a black 9p would play C9 against another 9p. Perhaps not (or only an extremely aggressive 9p, like Sakata).
I guess it is my style to play on the edge or over it :)

C[quiller: I think B should play D12 here. It seems to focus more on the centre whish is where B has to run
]
C[davos: I didn't really consider D12.
Wouldn't white D11, black C1, white C13 force black into extremely heavy shape?
]
C[davos: Erratum: I mean C10 instead of C1
]
C[quiller: I thought D12 D11 E11 C10 D10 C11 F10 would work for B, aiming at the aji of D13 or E7
]
C[davos: Ok, so the difference with the game is that black has more aji at C13. 
I don't know. If black tries to use this aji, white can defend by connecting at D14 and connecting at B9.
Black could also use the D13 aji by playing at b9 himself, but that would be similar to the game result.
All in all its not that clear to me yet that D12 is better than B10.
]
C[quiller: The difference seems obvious. If b can separate the C12 and D14 stones in sente then the direction of the attack is seriously undermined. when w hanes at G10 he is helping encircle his own group at D14 which is simply a bad result. If you admit that B was lucky w played at L10 then it seems clear this is a bad result for B and you should be looking for something better
]
C[davos: L10? I don't understand which lucky move you mean.
About the encircling: In the game, white was encircled too and he was was still somewhat handicapped by black's stone at C14, although there was a white move at D12 instead of a black move.
I still don't feel any regrets about B10.

C[davos: I think this move weakens white's attack.
]
C[quiller: This is a mistak by w and lets b off the hook. B's play here hasn't helped much. W should simply play H11

C[davos: I think this move is too thin.  It is sente, focring black to secure the bottom, but J7 does not really cover white's weaknesses in the center. It feels a bit like a thank you move.
]
C[quiller: I couldn't find a more secure move that was sente. But you make very strong points
]
C[davos: How about White K4? That would be big as it would build strong influence and keeps black's bottom group unsettled. Black can't connect his unsettled groups, so he would have to settle both separately. 
J7 stakes all on the attack of the left black group even while being handicapped by the mistake of E9.

C[davos: I expected this peep, but I also expected that this peep may eventually end up getting white into damezumari as in the game.
]
C[quiller: true, but it preserves sente
]
;B[gk]
;W[fl]
C[davos: I was a bit worried that white would cut at G13 and abandon F9 white stones for the time being, because it is a burden to save them at this moment.

C[davos: This sequence show that J7 didn't really help white's shape. J7 is more or less captured.
]
C[davos: Black's invasion ended up being a success for black.
White has a difficult game now.
]
C[quiller: This I'm not so certain about. B is only alove in ko at this stage and j7 isn't captured, but it hasn't turned out too badly I will grant
]
;W[jm]
;B[jl]
;W[km]
;B[kl]
;W[ji]
C[davos: Indeed white has to worry about a black cut here. But perhaps white should play at M8 anyway, because allowing black M7 will make the game too easy for black.
]
C[davos: If white has to defend at K11 in the midst of a fight, shouldn't he refrain from extending at K7 at all (F16 would be big too).
]
C[quiller: No, w wants to force b to live by playing ko, b doesn't have too many liberties
]
C[davos: But white has to save L7 first for this plan to work, doesn't he?
Isn't that hard if b plays M7?
White has some insecure stones at the bottom too.
I think it will be tough to get a lot of liberties with L7 without adversely affecting the white stones at the bottom.
]
C[quiller: The weak grp at the bottom is irrelevent if b can capture the side. B has approximately 7 liberties on the side of the board. B can hane at m7 but it isn't easy to keep w separated and keep his loberties down especially since the cutting point at M8 is a big threat BECAUSE of K11.
]
C[quiller: ok, well I'm just wrong here - in which case E9 simply loses the entire game
]
C[davos: Would it be possible for white to hane at M8 instead of K11? 
Perhaps this would accomplish white's goals of saving white's stones at H11 as well as white's stones at L7?
Black can't cut at J11 immediately, because then white will play J10 and K10.
]
C[quiller: I tried that sequence but it didn't seem to improve things for me.
]
;B[al]
C[davos: Silly move. With this move, black's group still has only 1.5 eyes. And it isn't that big territorially. Black should play M7.
]
C[quiller: absolutely
]
;W[lm]
C[davos: There you have it. Suddenly Black's easy position turned into a difficult position where anything can happen.

C[davos: How about white F16? That would threaten black's group too and it would secure white's stones on the outside.
]
C[quiller: Very good point
]
;B[fg]
;W[eg]
C[davos: Whouldn't F16 be bigger?Black may be able to capture D15, but then white could play F17 in sente too.
]
C[davos: And on top of that, blacks' group on the left would lack eyes.
]
C[quiller: I wanted to steal liverties off B but my play round here was generally ill-considered

C[davos: Black has a nice attack here, but suddenly black realizes that his group on the left can still become a ko.
]
;B[bn]
;W[dn]
;B[aj]
C[davos: I doubt that this move is any good. Black A7 would be big and it give black internal ko-threats. A10 just offers white an opportunity to play A7 in sente. I was too much going for safety.
]
;W[am]
;B[cj]
C[quiller: N2 would be better for w here
]
;W[eq]
C[davos: Yes, White N2 would be safe. But black bungles the ko fight here, so white doesn't lose that much.

;B[gc]
C[davos: My reading was not accurate. I thought this was a ko threat, but when white captured the ko, I couldn't find a way to kill white.
]
C[davos: The biggest gain out of this move is that it is big in itself. So it isn't really a ko threat, it is just a big endgame move.
]
;W[hs]
;B[df]
C[quiller: Such a bad result for W
]
C[davos: Did white lose much if you compare white N2 instead of E3? White gained points at the bottom and lost points in the topleft. I don't think white lost more than 3 points or so. So black hardly punished white for playing E3.
]
C[quiller: Except that play F6 became sente and it was a big move
]
C[davos: F6?
]
C[davos: Ah, you mean F6. Black only got to play it in gote.

C[quiller: O17 would be best for w here
]
C[davos: Yes, thanks to black J10, white lives in sente.
]
C[davos: So J10 could have been the losing move if white had seized the opportunity to play O17.
]
;W[kj]
C[davos: Not needed to live. L10 threatens to capture 4 black stones in gote by playing M9, but there are bigger moves now, like O17.
]
;B[nc]
C[quiller: Game over, w has no chance of catching up now. L10 is useless
]
;W[hb]
;B[qr]
;W[rr]
;B[qi]
C[davos: The exchange of R2 for S2 is a small mistake if black doesn't defend at Q2, because white can capture R2 in sente. But this doesn't affect the result.

C[davos: 10 points. Perhaps white should have played M9 instead of O18?
]
C[davos: O12 would have been better for black than M9. It's safer and eventually black still feels obliged to play O12.
]
C[quiller: The difference between w o18 and b n18 is bigger than 10 pts
]
C[davos: I'm not too good at exact value calculations, but my feeling is that the remaining aji of black L18 reduces the value of O18. Black can later regain a bit because of it. But I cannot offer hard numbers to back this up.
]
C[quiller: b has lost o18 p18 p19 q19 and s18 in sente while w has gained L19 M19 and M18 in the same sequence. even allowing that w must fill in either way. 10 got ppoints is big but still smaller than this sequence
]
C[quiller: after b n18 w m18 b o19 w must answer or die giving b sente to play s10 t9 - b isn't afraid of the resulting ko - he has a lot of good threats
 Anyway, the result is good without this
]
C[davos: You're right. O18 is about 8 points, but it is reverse sente, so it is bigger than 10 points double gote (because sente is worth more than 2 points after white has played his privilige at P19)
