C[Uberdude: There is a question about which side of r10 to play. I can't tell much difference here, but if black hadn't exchanged c14 for f17 then r12/r13 is maybe a bit better as coupled with f17 approach black has more potential on the top side than on the bottom due to strong f3.
]
C[Uberdude: This r7 rather than r8 is a leisurely choice.
]
;W[qg]
C[Uberdude: If r7 was at r8 then I would play r14, as r13 would be a cramped 2 space extension so black could attack it later. Like this it has some room at r8 or s8.

C[Uberdude: As black I would have p3 now, as I think it's good for white to take the r3 corner in sente.

C[Uberdude: This was a difficult decision, my other idea was p10 to reinforce that group now that black is stronger at r7.
]
;B[kq]
C[Uberdude: I expected black to attack at p10 now.
]
;W[oj]
C[Uberdude: Therefore I was happy to get j3 and p10, l3 seems slow.
]
;B[go]
C[Uberdude: This was a nice move to develop the centre, so perhaps j3 wasn't as good as I thought. Black is aiming at g3 g2 f2, but in the game I answered too submissively and let black build a big centre moyo. Maybe I should reduce right away around g10, but I didn't know what to do if black played g3.

C[Uberdude: This white thickness isn't useful, p5 wall is super strong.

C[Uberdude: If I did the normal move at g17 I thought I would be over 10 points behind, so needed something special.

C[Uberdude: I was happy now, g14 worked in reducing the black middle, though at the cost of my top side being broken.

C[Uberdude: This is aji keshi, although pushing at q10 isn't particularly appealing now, it may be later once black gets some stones nearby from the centre fight.

C[Uberdude: I still felt behind and that I needed to come in j10 h9 would let black win.

C[Uberdude: A nice little sente reduction.
]
;W[om]
C[Uberdude: A kikashi to help k8
]
;B[on]
C[Uberdude: Maybe directly capturing is better. This does make the white stone heavier, but conversly q7 can be useful.
]
;W[pm]
;B[pn]
;W[il]
C[Uberdude: All out move, I'd rather just reduce safely at m8 but I think black gets too many points that way. This odd looking shape is better than j9 as that makes k9 black's sente so L8 is severe.
]
;B[li]
C[Uberdude: A little soft, I thought there was a real danger k8 could die, or p10 in a splitting attack.
]
;W[ll]
;B[jh]
;W[bn]
C[Uberdude: There's still some bad aji around n9, but I can't afford to fix. The game seems close now, maybe black a little better.
]
;B[bm]
;W[bo]
;B[bc]
C[Uberdude: Good timing, if black played c8 right away I was planning to play b17, it's biggest endgame now.
]
;W[bb]
;B[cl]
;W[pg]
C[Uberdude: This white group still not 100% alive, so trying to make it live with good yose.
]
;B[ni]
C[Uberdude: This looks a nice shape, but maybe p13 actually better.
]
;W[oi]
C[Uberdude: As this push and cut seems to work thanks to q7 (which is why p6 may be wrong): p12 o12 p13 o13 p14 n11 o10 n10 o9 n9 o8 o7  p8 q8. There are some other variations like p13 o13. Also there is a chance black may be able to use the aji of saving n11 to capture m8 and k8 with something like n9.
]
C[Uberdude: *p13 at o13
]
;B[ng]
C[Uberdude: So I am happy to have the option to capture 2 stones as it is good profit and makes me strong.
]
;W[rf]
;B[re]
;W[oh]
C[Uberdude: If I lost this game, this would be the losing move (other than letting black make the good moyo in the opening). I would like to play o18 p18 k2 l2 first as they look like double sente, and I would be overjoyed if black did answer them. But I feared black would tenuki one of them (say not playing l2) and play p12, then if I follow up on my tenuki with m2 black can play o9 which is a severe attack on p10 group and m8. It is quite possible one of them will die and I couldn't be sure of my reading that I could save both. But as I think I am behind, maybe I should take the risk. Instead I staked the game on yose.

C[Uberdude: Biggest move.

;W[se]
;B[sd]
;W[sf]
;B[rd]
;W[nm]
C[Uberdude: If I block at s10 it's a good exchange, so I give up the points on the side and try to make a few in the middle. It's also thick and makes sure m8 is safe. Black could have gained some yose by hassling that connection.

C[Uberdude: Maybe o10 is bigger. This is 3 points reverse sente, o10 is >3 but gote for black.

C[Uberdude: I missed this good move, only expected m9.
]
;W[kl]
;B[lk]
;W[dg]
C[Uberdude: This is big, as it stops black playing e13 in sente which he should have done before o10.
]
;B[cg]
;W[eh]
;B[ch]
;W[ig]
C[Uberdude: Maybe black can resist at d14, I'm not sure which is bigger. But if I play d14 now then black j13 seems to be the biggest move. The game is so close I need to get all the points in sente I can and hope black doesn't call my bluff.
]
;B[kg]
;W[ce]
;B[be]
;W[df]
;B[lp]
C[Uberdude: Not sure what the best move is here. The game is very close, I wasn't sure who was winning as this area hard to count.
]
;W[ie]
C[Uberdude: Bad move, as black's not going to play j15 as a point in reverse sente yet. This gives black h16 group more liberties so the h18 throw in I had later was not so good.
]
;B[he]
;W[mo]
C[Uberdude: I calculated this was 6 points (if black gets n6 then as well as building some and taking w's n7 point, even if white gets n7 to stop o8 being a false eye white needs to spend a move inside after dame if cut at l6 due to p9 atari and q8) to s11's 5, so maybe e4 3 points in reverse is actually best for white.

C[Uberdude: The winning move, I was planning to play g19 which is 3 points (not 2 because of e18 and d17 cuts), but if black then plays p14 it seems I lose by half a point. Even if black ignores this and plays f19 I think I win.
]
;B[nf]
;W[fp]
C[Uberdude: I did slightly fear black tenuki to f19 (as e8 for e7 exchange makes f5 less good for white so this not quite so sente).
]
;B[fo]
;W[ga]
C[Uberdude: d4 is not sente now, black's best answer would be f19. Very imporant to play the sente yose at the right time.
]
;B[ha]
;W[fa]
C[Uberdude: This shows that j15 was a bad move, had I not played it then I could play h18 h17 j19 and black can't connect, and when he tenukis I can then take in sente.

;B[os]

;W[km]
;B[ia]
C[Uberdude: This is 1 point reverse sente if white is going to play j19 1pt sente. But I hadn't played j19 before l7 as it is aji keshi. My other option there is h18 h17 j19 which is 1 and a third points in gote, but also takes the eye. This makes p15 half a point bigger as that cuts the central black group and means k9 takes a further point as then black needs to defend inside or else (once dame filled) l10 m10 l12 l11 n13 n14 self atari m13 capture.
]
C[Uberdude: So black should play r14 s13 q14 p13 p15 ehre instead. It creates one point, creates the opportunity for 1 more at o16 (so valued at half), and stops white's p15 which includes the p16 half. And by connecting means the h18 throw in to destroy the eye doesn't have the k9 value.
]
C[Uberdude: That why white wins by 0.5
]
C[Uberdude: *That way
]
;W[dk]
;B[ck]
;W[am]
C[Uberdude: This and t5 are exactly miai 2 ponts gote which is why they can be left to after 1 point moves.
]
C[Uberdude: But I chose this one as it gives me more ko threats (could be useful at a19).
]
;B[al]
;W[an]
;B[sn]
C[Uberdude: Black misclicked (meant to t5), but white t5 1 pt reverse sente which might seem like a punishment isn't actually the biggest move, p15 is, so it reverts.
]
;W[oe]
C[Uberdude: It was only after I played this that I realised it's even bigger than I thought (so should play here not l7 1pt reverse sente) as p16 means black needs to fix inside.

C[Uberdude: Black could p16 to save a point and fight the ko, but unlike the other game, white doesn't need to win the ko to win the game.
