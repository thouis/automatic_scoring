C[KlausP: If white cannot improve the endgame he must play d2 here black lives in gote with f2 and needs to answer anny connection (c3, d3 or d4) at h2 or h4. than  white cann dammage blacks corner.

C[KlausP: The strange looking e4 looks a little better here, but this might be wrong. It seems to leave a Ko, if black plays g2 and h1 later.
