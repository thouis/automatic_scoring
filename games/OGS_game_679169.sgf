C[vwhite: The game information say that the clock goes up to a maximum of 3 minutes, yet it seems like it goes up to 15

C[Plunder: this looks not good for white =(
]
C[desanex: can someone tell me why b played p8 not p9?

C[desanex: d1. From move 38: P9 P8 Q10 P10 
]
C[desanex: also this would happen
]
;W[mq]
C[desanex: I see
]
;B[os]
;W[mr]
;B[mg]
;W[mh]
C[Plunder: in situations like this white will play "light", meaning it will not make a clump of stones and is willing to give up some of his/her stones for good shape
]

;W[lp]
;B[nh]
;W[oh]
;B[ni]
;W[lg]
;B[mf]
;W[qj]
;B[oi]
C[Plunder: white now gave up the 6 stones on the bottom right to get the outside stones of N3 and make the bottom side almost certain points
]
;W[pj]
C[Mikasa: atari was wrong :|
]
C[Mikasa: cut first haha
]
;B[mi]
C[wtw: atari is always wrong :D

C[hikaru1no1go: so
]
C[hikaru1no1go: who is winning
]
C[desanex: I see. Thanks

C[hikaru1no1go: -_-
]
C[hikaru1no1go: ?
]
;B[lh]
;W[rg]
;B[ri]
;W[mo]
C[desanex: maybe black?
]
C[desanex: why was the atari evasion wrong tho?
]
C[Plunder: the O9 stones are weak, so I still think black is ahead
]
;B[oo]
;W[on]
C[Plunder: but....  it is hard to really make use of that weakness
]
;B[nn]
;W[no]
;B[pn]
;W[pm]
;B[qo]
;W[se]
;B[ll]
C[Plunder: So white still is still fine :)
]
;W[lk]
;B[kk]
C[gohiontach: the evasion wasn't wrong, desanex, putting white in atari was wrong, because she got out easily. as opposed to if black had cut first
]
;W[kj]
C[Fenced Icon: black plays well
]
C[gohiontach: (as I understood it)
]
;B[kl]
C[desanex: with the whole middle still empty white can save these blocks pretty easily, right? especially with a solid bottom left
]
;W[li]
;B[kh]
C[desanex: well not anymore
]
;W[jj]

C[Plunder: no ladder. >.<
]
C[Ghetta: Black is taking control of theboard tho
]
C[Plunder: no ladder :(. From move 116: M6 L7 K7 L6 L5 K6 J6 K5 
]
;W[do]
;B[fn]
;W[dl]
;B[gm]
;W[cl]
C[desanex: also... why doesn't white seal the deal with o4 etc
]
;B[dm]
;W[dk]
;B[bl]
;W[dj]
C[Plunder: no deal. From move 131: O4 Q6 
]
;B[hn]
;W[mn]
;B[nm]
;W[km]
C[Ghetta: black should cut at l4
]
;B[bq]
;W[bk]
C[desanex: and why doesn't black play q6?
]
;B[gq]
C[Plunder: cut at L4?
]
;W[em]
;B[en]
;W[br]
C[Plunder: Q6 is small 
]
;B[el]
;W[aq]
C[Ghetta: That would make it an atari which could be built from
]
;B[bn]
;W[gr]
;B[hr]
C[Plunder: and she will get those stones anyway
]

C[desanex: okai, makes sense. Thanks!
]
;B[io]
C[Fenced Icon: to my 30k eyes white is so dead.... what can he do to reverse the flow ?
]
;W[jd]
;B[ep]
C[Plunder: which white is dead?
]
;W[cp]
C[Fenced Icon: the white player
]
;B[bo]
C[vwhite: You mean behind?
]
C[spacecow20: yeah, his stone is right in the crosshairs!
]
;W[fs]
C[Fenced Icon: yes i mean behind
]
;B[hs]
C[Plunder: you think?
]
C[Fenced Icon: well i had the impression some minutes ago

;B[gd]
C[vwhite: it does

C[crodgers: yes

C[desanex: jupp

;W[hi]
C[Fenced Icon: qq
]
;B[hf]
C[desanex: is top right really predetermined tho?
]
;W[gg]
C[vwhite: btw, do you find that when you draw the line appears a bit away from the courser, or is that just me
]
C[Animiral: really? I can't read the numbers
]
;B[ie]
C[Animiral: is that an 8
]
C[Plunder: yes
]
;W[hc]
C[Animiral: the bottom one :P
]
;B[eg]
C[Plunder: I don't think it is possible to write?
]
C[Plunder: yes, bottom I wrote 18
]
C[Plunder: but maybe that is a bit opimistic
]
;W[hd]
C[flowing: ah, good, i was wondering how you estimate "~60"
]
C[mark5000: Seems finely balanced, if you ask me.
]
C[Animiral: :D
]
C[Plunder: but now what is screwing up a bit =(
]
;B[gf]
C[Fenced Icon: its approx ~8
]
;W[ff]
;B[ef]
C[asdf1234: isnt the right more than 23?
]
C[Plunder: maybe :P 
]
;W[gi]
C[Plunder: maybe 26 actually :D

C[mark5000: Two empty triangles in a row!
]
C[mark5000: Take notes guys
]
;B[rp]
C[mark5000: Just kidding.
]
C[mark5000: They're okay
]
C[gohiontach: T3 seems like a give-away. can anyone explain it to me?
]
C[Fenced Icon: this is better than world cup
]
;W[je]
;B[jf]
;W[kf]
C[Plunder: I don't understand T3 either, maybe time-suji :D
]
C[Levvo: Looks like a pretty close game.
]
C[Ghetta: if black can somehow minimize territory atK16 she wins
]
C[Ghetta: K16*
]
;B[ki]
;W[nd]
;B[ne]
C[Plunder: I think black won after capturing the D16 stones
]
;W[jg]
C[mark5000: K13 is big
]
C[Ghetta: Territory at the top is too big
]
;B[if]
;W[kg]
;B[jh]
;W[le]
;B[id]
;W[ic]
C[Fenced Icon: black could try to capture the giant white cluster from S9 to f14
]
C[Fenced Icon: ?
]
C[Fenced Icon: :)

;B[im]

C[vwhite: I think the l9 stones are dead

C[wtw: thx
]
C[Mikasa: Thanks
]
C[Mikasa: phew
]
C[Mikasa: You are tough
]
C[wtw: I completely forgot H8^^
]
C[Mikasa: I always seem to take the lead in the opening
]
C[wtw: I thought the game was ok before that
]
C[Mikasa: But, than you always catch up
]
C[Mikasa: You are powerful in middle game and powerful in endgame
]
C[wtw: that's because we have different evaluations of the opening :p
]
C[Mikasa: In order to win I have to slice you in the opening than I can only hold my ground and take punches like a punching bag haha
]
C[wtw: for me, the opening is about even, then I have to resist your punches
]
C[Mikasa: I don't feel like I got to throw any except in the upper left haha
]
C[wtw: well, H8 was really painful XD
]
C[Mikasa: Yeah I am glad I saw that
]
C[Mikasa: I think without that I would have lost
]
C[wtw: I shouldn't play the ko I think
]
C[wtw: not the H8 ko, and not the A9 ko either for that matter ^^
]
C[Mikasa: Oh
]
C[Mikasa: Which ko?
]
C[wtw: d1. From move 215: F9 F7 
]
C[Mikasa: Yeah but this is still ko
]
C[Mikasa: Or not really ko but atleast G8 stone lives now
]
C[Mikasa: like this. From move 215: F9 F7 H9 J9 K9 G9 F8 H9 
]
C[wtw: yeah, for example
]
C[Mikasa: Black still gains but white now has more
]
C[Mikasa: Than he did before
]
C[wtw: although there's no need to play H9 either
]
C[Mikasa: Right
]
C[Mikasa: Can just tenuki
]
C[wtw: d2. From move 215: F9 J9 K9 F7 A9 
]
C[Mikasa: Oh no can't tenuki
]
C[Mikasa: Have to live with d8
]
C[wtw: this would be reasonable I think
]
C[Mikasa: Yeah
]
C[Mikasa: Thanks forthe game
]
C[wtw: thank you
]
C[crodgers: gg
]
C[crodgers: you guys are fierce
