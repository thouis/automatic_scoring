C[Uberdude: I think this is a mistake and I should b18 to punish black for not continuing the joseki sequence: d3 is just one stone so it's light, whereas e14 and g17 are both big potentially heavy groups.
]
C[iznogoud: but maybe I would be happy to get b3

C[Uberdude: This was a surprise, I expected b18 to settle then k17 p17.

C[Uberdude: Not defending the e14 group seemed a bit greedy, but it's not easy to see how to take advantage.
]
C[Uberdude: Also I thought black d12 c12 d11 would be quite hard to answer, though with c8 weak I should be able to cope.
]
C[iznogoud: As I saw you didn't know how to attack e14, I then invaded the left side soon ;)
I agree I should play something that helps e14

C[Uberdude: It is a weak point of the shape, but maybe too early as the centre is not yours with h15 gap and weak group?

C[Uberdude: I felt bad to connect submissively like this, but at least r3 and r13 are both gote for black now.

C[Uberdude: I suppose this way you settled half the group with some points and weakened c10, but the attack on g14 seemed to give me a nice flow to control the game and make sure p12 didn't make points.

C[iznogoud: the invasion on left side was a bad choice, difficult game for me...

C[Uberdude: If you defended at n16 I wasn't sure if h4 was too slow.

;B[gp]
C[Uberdude: This sequence seemed good for me, as I was worried about you breaking the territory here, maybe g3? Can't remember what my plan was to respond to that.
]
C[iznogoud: I didn't think g3 was possible because d5 is not completely settled
]
C[iznogoud: I tried to get sente to play m7 and help l9 group which is my burden after the left invasion

C[Uberdude: I really wanted to tenuki to play r14 tedomari, and think I was lucky to win once you got it. If I tenuki I don't think you can kill my big group, there's so much aji so this seems too cautious.

C[Uberdude: Rage! with white r14 this easily works, but now does seem a bit risky.

C[Uberdude: All in!

C[iznogoud: I'm behind, and you maybe give me a little chance to get back...

C[Uberdude: p18 is better here as then I have 0 eyes in the corner and less points if I live.

C[Uberdude: Phew! if b r14 I wasn't sure what would happen, looks like it could be a semeai and there were many variations so I wasn't sure I would win.

C[Uberdude: If I answer you have many more threats, and I thought this put me ~10 points ahead for an easy win but it ended up a lot closer.

C[Uberdude: Probably with is the bad move that loses a big win, but I wanted to make my group totally alive. t4 should be a lot better for points though.
