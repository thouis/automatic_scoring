C[xhu98: So currently we are compiling a catalog for teachers in GO Basics
]
C[xhu98: It is currently available on the forum
]
C[xhu98: So since you are one of us, it'd be great to see a list of past reviews you have done on OGS
]
C[xhu98: For example, I have my own reviews and teachings managed in the catalog :)
]
C[xhu98: And as people request teaching games or reviews, the catalog will be updated
]

C[herminator: Ok. I've not done many reviews on OGS yet though. I did one for your tournament, and I've sometimes talked a few variations with an opponent, but that's about it :)

C[xhu98: WHOA
]
C[herminator: Yeah, I was afraid of that :)
]
C[xhu98: 0.5 points
]
C[herminator: I figured you were very slightly ahead
]
C[xhu98: Yeah probably
]
C[herminator: I had estimated it 1.5 or 2.5
]
C[xhu98: I was surprised to get the bottom left corner
]
C[herminator: Can't believe I let that J-group happen
]
C[xhu98: yeah :/
]
C[xhu98: Otherwise it'd be clear win for you :)
]
C[herminator: I know the shape and all the variations
]
C[xhu98: Of course :D
]
C[herminator: and then during the ko I failed to pay attention :)
]
C[xhu98: I didn't think about the close outcome :)
]
C[xhu98: So i just played loosely
]
C[herminator: I had a great game all game, white just kept ending up with small groups :)
]
C[herminator: But of course I should refrain from dying then :)
]
C[xhu98: yup
]
C[xhu98: I was upset with being sealed in the center
]
C[herminator: Yeah I as ahppy I could sacrifice the left side so efficiently
]
C[xhu98: I expected this. From move 126: G16 
]
C[herminator: And even get ko threats from it
]
C[xhu98: Yeah
]
C[xhu98: But then I somehow lived a small group in your territory
]
C[herminator: Yeah, that looks good too
]
C[herminator: No wy I can keep that all though :)
]
C[xhu98: That I would resign right away :)
]
C[xhu98: I should have enclosed at E17 instead of F17, I think
]
C[herminator: I think the whole game you focussed too much on small local territory, an I kept getting all this thickness
]
C[xhu98: Right
]
C[xhu98: The bottom right battle was terrible for me :)
]
C[herminator: yes
]
C[herminator: I don't thnk Q4  is possible, is it?
]
C[xhu98: It probably is
]
C[xhu98: But not when Black is strong outside
]
C[herminator: I expected R4
]
C[xhu98: Yeah that'd be normal
]
C[xhu98: Had there were no Black stones around
]
C[xhu98: It could be a fair fighting pattern, I think
]
C[herminator: Did a quick check
]
C[herminator: Josekipedia calls it an overplay
]
C[xhu98: That matches my style then :D
]
C[herminator: So it is probably only playable when white is strong in the area :)
]
C[xhu98: yeah
]
C[herminator: hahaha :)
]
C[herminator: Well, I'm off to bed
]
C[xhu98: I was just so lucky to have that L-shape kill :)
]
C[xhu98: Good game!
]
C[herminator: It's after midnight here :)
]
C[xhu98: 2-5 now
]
C[xhu98: Have a good night and well played!
]
C[herminator: yeah, moving in the wrong direction :)
]
C[herminator: see you next game!
]
C[xhu98: ^^
]
C[Pheonid: wow, 0.5 points
