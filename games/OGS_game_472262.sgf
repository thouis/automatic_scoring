]
C[Hongyu7: a little weird.
]
C[paintcan: site chooses 7.5 for chinese rules
]
C[Hongyu7: oh i c
]
C[paintcan: it makes it equivalent to 6.5 komi with japanese rules
]
C[paintcan: i think
]
C[paintcan: something like that
]
C[paintcan: i hope we may play again sometime, it's an education
]
C[Hongyu7: :D
]
C[Hongyu7: why not.
]
C[paintcan: :)
]
C[paintcan: i hope gu li wins
]
C[Hongyu7: so . u asian ?
]
C[paintcan: nope, white canadian
]
C[Hongyu7: wow. u play fairly good as a white.
]
C[paintcan: you live in china?
]
C[Hongyu7: yes. beijing.
]
C[paintcan: cool
]
C[Hongyu7: gull lives here.
]
C[Hongyu7: can u speak chinese ?
]
C[paintcan: there are some very strong white players, but they are mostly in europe
]
C[paintcan: in finland
]
C[paintcan: not at all, sorry
]
C[Hongyu7: ama 6d
]
C[paintcan: chinese 6d? wow
]
C[paintcan: very strong
]
C[Hongyu7: no.
]
C[Hongyu7: i am 5d.
]
C[paintcan: ah
]
C[paintcan: chinese 5d very strong though
]
C[Hongyu7: i am the weakest 5d maybe.
]
C[Hongyu7: :D
]
C[paintcan: :p
]
C[paintcan: what's your advice, to get so strong?
]
C[Hongyu7: there are three type of 5d.
]
C[paintcan: mm, tell me
]
C[Hongyu7: weak/average/strong
]
C[Hongyu7: in chinese we call soft5, 5, strong5
]
C[paintcan: i see
]
C[paintcan: well, in china, 6d is normally the highest right?
]
C[paintcan: it makes sense you'd have the three types
]
C[paintcan: too much strength in one rank
]
C[Hongyu7: when 5d won a title in big ama game.
]
C[paintcan: oh
]
C[paintcan: i thought it was, 7d was honorary for winning huge tournament
]
C[paintcan: i didn't know even 5d you had to win a big game
]
C[paintcan: oh, it's 6d that it is
]
C[paintcan: sorry, i misunderstood
]
C[Hongyu7: yes nation ama game maybe 
]
C[Hongyu7: now advice to u.
]
C[Hongyu7: u play go in a mild way.
]
C[Hongyu7: maybe u are weak in fight.
]
C[paintcan: i think i'm weak in every part of game, but that's probably true
]
C[paintcan: actually, i fall behind easily
]
C[paintcan: mostly only win when i kill
]
C[paintcan: i hoped to keep the game even and balanced, but you got a nice advantage early
]
C[Hongyu7: kill is the most important skill in go game.
]
C[paintcan: F16 is a move i like to use a lot, i'm not used to having someone play it against me
]
C[paintcan: it was nice to see how a stronger player uses it
]
C[Hongyu7: when u weak u can't make balance.
]
C[paintcan: in your estimation, when was balance lost?
]
C[Hongyu7: D10
]
C[paintcan: i think when you played L13, game was already over
]
C[paintcan: ah
]
C[paintcan: that makes sense
]
C[paintcan: my thought was
]
C[paintcan: F16 gave you central power
]
C[paintcan: and the cut at F4 is bothersome
]
C[paintcan: so why not play D10 to try to make F16 and F4 less useful
]
C[paintcan: but it was giving too much away
]
C[Hongyu7: oh. now i know why u play d10
]
C[Hongyu7: C13 is better then D10
]
C[paintcan: that makes sense
]
C[Hongyu7: E16 is also a good move
]
C[paintcan: f17 was quite strong
]
C[paintcan: then it's balanced by territory
]
C[paintcan: it makes sense
]
C[Hongyu7: to here.
]
C[Hongyu7: the 4 stones group are weak.
]
C[Hongyu7: connections is not stable.
]
C[paintcan: both sides have a weakness
]
C[Hongyu7: yes
]
C[paintcan: c13 is much more patient than D10
]
C[Hongyu7: 2 3_in_one 
]
C[paintcan: takes territory, and makes f4 less important
]
C[paintcan: because then the C9 area becomes weaker
]
C[paintcan: during game, i thought c13 was too small / slow
]
C[paintcan: but it's clear it's better than d10
]
C[paintcan: now that you explain it
]
C[Hongyu7: when u play c13, white can't f4
]
C[paintcan: right
]
C[paintcan: white too weak after
]
C[Hongyu7: can u see the board ?
]
C[paintcan: ah, you have to
