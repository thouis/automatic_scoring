C[KyuT: What about N4 instead of this?
]
C[Uberdude: Hmm, didn't occur to me, seems not enough base taking.
]
C[KyuT: It just seems to work with your other stones and I really don't want to end up living in that corner
]

C[Uberdude: m3 yourself?
]
C[KyuT: I don't like it. O3 was a silly move, if I want to limit the damage then I think I have to make sure I get some kind of shape and access to the centre. I like how my group looked 3 moves from here

C[KyuT: Is this really best? You can't N3 or something?

C[Uberdude: Duh! That does look rather stronger doesn't it.

C[Uberdude: I was reasonably happy to get the big corner; ended up almost as big as my moyo.
]
C[KyuT: I think this is too close now. Maybe something in the top right or at least something further up the side. I don't want to activate R6 with my group still only 1 eye.
]
C[Uberdude: q13 perhaps then and go for big side. p15 did end up rather a liability that didn't really help my moyo.

C[Uberdude: Should I f17?
]
C[KyuT: I'm not sure. The game looks funny now. G17 seems fairly obvious and nice for me after N16 so I'd want to play something different just for that reason. M6? :D
]
;W[gc]
;B[jn]
C[Uberdude: Maybe this is soft if I plan on letting you get d2 in sente. C2 is pretty big for me too as if you take sente afterwards I can get b8 in sente, which would then have made c15 instead of g14 more reasonable.
]
C[KyuT: It seems slow to me though the top half of the board looks so odd. I'm not sure where I'd have played. I guess C2. I have to be careful about reducing your bottom territory anyway

C[KyuT: Painful, but I think better than running in this case. Now just sit back and see what you do and find a way to deal with the center now all my groups are 100% alive

C[Uberdude: And it all turned to dame. But if I L13 instead of d13 you d12 or so.
]
C[KyuT: I liked this move. I was a bit scared you might play something like J11 or even K11
]
;B[mh]
C[Uberdude: My play here was restricted by treating p15 as a weak group.
]
C[KyuT: It definitely felt like that. I think you shouldn't have worried about it so much. You tenukied it enough you have to treat it as light.

C[Uberdude: I felt like resigning in shame now.

C[KyuT: Is that the best move? Isn't R11 too easy for me?

C[Uberdude: If I went further I saw r6 coming back to life.

C[Uberdude: Sharp to get the wedge, I though you would just L5 in which case o16 was bigger, but now...

C[Uberdude: I suppose I should L5, you planned on extending or L6? I was afraid of L6. Also demonstrated that o9 was bad taking my own liberties.
]
C[KyuT: Yeah, O9 hurt you. I wasn't sure this worked for me. But I felt slightly behind so though I had to and the continuations were so complicated it didn't seem worth it for you to risk it.
