C[thl: yes that was a mistake

C[howard.a.landman: 20 point mistake, might be enough for you
]
C[howard.a.landman: not sure how I lost the upper right either.  I had convinced myself that it was alive.
]
C[thl: in the bottom i was too optimistic. I did not even think that body would be dead.
]
C[thl: If I win this game I was just lucky
]
C[howard.a.landman: I think you're a little ahead now

C[howard.a.landman: 8.5
]
C[thl: I was really lucky. 
]
C[howard.a.landman: maybe a little closer if I defend after B13, but you still win
]
C[howard.a.landman: You fought hard on the upper side, but I wasn't sure why you even started it.  There were still many big points elsewhere.  It seemed too early to me.
]
C[howard.a.landman: also, you didn't need to answer my ko threats in upper right.  Just conect A19 and W top left is dead.  Much bigger
]
C[howard.a.landman: Then I have to resign.
]
C[howard.a.landman: Here I needed to defend.
]
C[howard.a.landman: Missing O9 here was losing move
]
C[howard.a.landman: maybe should have been ko for life
]
C[howard.a.landman: This throw-in is bad, maybe kills your group
]
C[howard.a.landman: Just here
]
C[howard.a.landman: no problems
]
C[howard.a.landman: maybe the solid connection would have been better
]
C[howard.a.landman: I think this lives
]
C[howard.a.landman: maybe not
]
C[thl: I sorry someone visited me. Now I am back
]
C[howard.a.landman: trying to see if you could live in center.  Maybe.  It's complicated.
]
C[thl: I haven't played for a long time. I often make silly mistakes. I haven't recovered a sense of games
]
C[thl: Yes, that's right.
]
C[howard.a.landman: B wins this way I think
]
C[howard.a.landman: B wins this way too
]
C[thl: I was too optimistic in the bottom. I thought I would win the game. 
]
C[howard.a.landman: I didn't expect you to try to save these
]
C[thl: d1. From move 212: P8 O7 O9 Q8 P9 Q9 R8 
]
C[howard.a.landman: I thought something like this would happen
]
C[thl: I should put P8
]
C[howard.a.landman: I'm happy with the squeeze after this
]
C[howard.a.landman: This was optimistic maybe
]
C[howard.a.landman: One reason your bottom group got into trouble was that you didn't answer B2
]
C[howard.a.landman: so later he monkey jump E1 is sente
]
C[howard.a.landman: After C8 here, B is winning. Last big point.
]
C[howard.a.landman: I was too afraid to play this way.
]
C[howard.a.landman: maybe it's OK though
]
C[howard.a.landman: F17 is error
]
C[howard.a.landman: doesn't work yet
]
C[thl: well
]
C[thl: It is not a mistake, i guess
]
C[howard.a.landman: so maybe W should play this way
]
C[howard.a.landman: this move surprised me
]
C[howard.a.landman: Expected something like this
]
C[howard.a.landman: D14 looks like a good shape move, but after B14 my shape is bad
]
C[thl: D14 was too shy.
]
C[howard.a.landman: I thought R17 would live.  Since that isn't true, I should have played differently.
]
C[howard.a.landman: I was expecting this
]
C[howard.a.landman: at this point I feel alive.  
]
C[thl: This shape is known to die if no response
]
C[howard.a.landman: probably this hane is better
]
C[thl: how about T18?
]
C[howard.a.landman: well, I need to sleep
]
C[thl: ok. it was a good time
]
C[thl: good sleep
