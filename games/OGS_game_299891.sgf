C[Uberdude: I suppose I could q10 instead  as if you k13 I can cut and you don't have ladder.

C[Uberdude: Strange that you tenukid when I played knight's move rather than 1 point jump as it should be more sente with m13 followup, but I decided that was slow.

C[Uberdude: I regretted now play r9 first, presumably something like r9 r14 r15 q14 o16 follows, but I feared losing sente and this c4 is huge.

I didn't r9 partly because I didn't know which side to go from, but in retrospect it seems obvious I should play from this side.

C[Uberdude: I misread here, thought you have to defend o14 for some reason (which is why I pushed to probe because maybe you give up the q15 2 stones later.
]
C[zealot: This s16 looked weird to me. I was expecting q19. Removing 1 liberty now seemed better. (Like this could gain two more in sente.)
]
C[Uberdude: I can't remember if I read it, but I was worrying about dying with other moves. At least this improves t14 yose.

C[Uberdude: Felt so bad when you tenukid, but was happy you did this rather than something more solid

C[Uberdude: Why peep here if you are going to q9 anyway? I thought you were planing to make my n9 gote so you can tenuki.
]
C[zealot: It's a long time ago, but I remember a nasty cut of M4 stick (or alternatively a too big sente reduction), involving o14 weakness. I can't really tell the details now, I felt l8 was (unfortunately) needed.

C[zealot: I overlooked this move, I had not seen it was hurting me so badâ€¦
]
C[Uberdude: Well at the time I was a bit annoyed you tenukid b9 as I just wanted to make sure you didn't turn there in sente on the corner and wasn't sure this was actually the biggest move but it seemed the right spirit. But yes cutting the group does have a lot of yose value.

C[Uberdude: So you realised I was planning something evil like f13 if you h18 ;-)
]
C[zealot: Yeah, due to c10 I was really not comfortable at all. I had to avoid death and not giving you all the cheese in the center. I was lucky to find this g12.
]
;B[fb]
;W[fj]
C[Uberdude: A bit vague?
]
C[zealot: I was considering that the bottom was quite big. I tried to get sente without giving you away to much points.
]
;B[dj]
C[Uberdude: I thought I'd play here as it's obviously a big point and it makes g10 look a bit odd, but given the corner sequence it seems o2 defence would be best.
]
C[Uberdude: I was thinking without much reading f10 meant I can't double hane if you d10, but I probably can.

C[Uberdude: I had a panic here and though t6 could kill, but n1 being my sente saves me.

C[zealot: Yeah one moment I also though it was sente. This n1 saves you :)

C[Uberdude: Good, I was hoping you made s8 mistake =). I wanted to t8 instead of d18 but feared it was gote.
]
C[zealot: Yeah I waited to keep k1 sente in case, but I could not afford to keep it any longer, I was expecting t8 pretty soon if I didn't played it.

C[Uberdude: Losing move? Not worth that many points. g6 would make a good dozen points for you in front of the wall.
]
C[zealot: Now, I see you are probably right, back then I though I had not enough points.

C[Uberdude: Having to tenuki this is painful

;W[fm]

C[Uberdude: I was a bit surprised you never followed up m13 here.

C[Uberdude: Reverse sente fighting spirit etc, but isn't this actually worse than e7 as it makes f11 more sente for me as it's killing your group if ignored twice.
]
C[zealot: The point was to get more threats to sustain the ko. I really feel I could lack some otherwise. two stones at e6+e7 is kind of a threat, and I also get threats at b3 sooner.
]
C[Uberdude: I never thought I could actually win the ko, I just did it for fun :p Maybe I should have started the ko earlier as a trick while you still had a few tempting reverse sentes on the board because winning the ko is 5/4 miai value.
