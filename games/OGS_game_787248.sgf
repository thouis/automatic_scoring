C[Meatbun: :( so close
]
C[xhu98: Oh god
]
C[xhu98: So close
]
C[xhu98: Yeah your opening was very successful
]
C[Meatbun: lol
]
C[Meatbun: i'm surprised it was...
]
C[xhu98: I think I captured the three stones at F12
]
C[xhu98: That could have been a game changer
]
C[xhu98: Surprised there are no kibitz
]
C[Meatbun: ya
]
C[xhu98: Another comeback
]
C[Meatbun: maybe we were too confusing?
]
C[xhu98: Haha, I don't know
]
C[Meatbun: i should of played K12 instead of L12
]
C[Meatbun: would have prevented the cut
]
C[xhu98: Yeah
]
C[Meatbun: but i wasn't really thinking of the f12 stones at the time XD
]
C[xhu98: Because if you save those stones
]
C[xhu98: You can break into my left side
]
C[xhu98: So you don't really need to worry about the little gap
]
C[Meatbun: or this would have been better. From move 124: F13 E14 E12 C13 
]
C[xhu98: Though that would have been another game. From move 136: G10 J11 F8 G7 E10 
]
C[xhu98: Nope that won't work. From move 124: F13 E14 E12 G16 
]
C[Meatbun: oh right lol
]
C[xhu98: That's what I HOPE
]
C[xhu98: xD
]
C[Meatbun: went one too far
]
C[xhu98: In fact you were still leading by one point
]
C[xhu98: I won on the komi
]
C[Meatbun: XD
]
C[xhu98: Otherwise this would be a half point win!!
]
C[xhu98: For you
]
C[Meatbun: :D
]
C[Meatbun: but losing e15 early was rough...
]
C[Meatbun: did not know that joseki
]
C[xhu98: Yeah it was, probably
]
C[xhu98: Your center was very huge though
]
C[Meatbun: was surprised i got as much as i did there
]
C[xhu98: Yeah
]
C[xhu98: A huge lead
]
C[xhu98: In the end I played some endgame moves to catch up
]
C[Meatbun: but your left isn't so small either XD
]
C[xhu98: Well, there was aji
]
C[Meatbun: ya
]
C[Meatbun: i couldn't only see the g6 aji though XD
]
C[xhu98: I think you let me loose there
]
C[xhu98: I got away with that
]
C[xhu98: Wow. Two comeback thrillers for me
]
C[Meatbun: this is better?
]
C[Meatbun: this. From move 144: F8 G7 F7 H7 G5 H4 F6 G4 E5 F4 E10 E9 D9 E8 D8 E7 E6 D7 E4 
]
C[Meatbun: actually yea it is...
]
C[xhu98: Sorry I couldn't see your variation
]
C[Meatbun: test. From move 144: F8 G7 F7 H7 G5 H4 F6 G4 E5 F4 E10 E9 D9 E8 D8 E7 E6 D7 E4 
]
C[Meatbun: let's try this again
]
C[xhu98: What if this?. From move 144: F8 G7 F7 H7 G5 H4 F6 F4 
]
C[Meatbun: variations aren't work now XD
]
C[Meatbun: but i don't think mine worked anyway
]
C[xhu98: Just refresh
]
C[xhu98: I can see them now
]
C[Meatbun: ah
]
C[Meatbun: yea
]
C[Meatbun: that doesn't help me XD
]
C[Meatbun: i don't know how i get a better result from that XD
]
C[Meatbun: oh well
]
C[Meatbun: 0-3 in the tournaments so far :)
]
C[xhu98: Probably. From move 142: G7 F8 G6 H5 G5 H4 G4 E2 E3 G3 F4 F2 D2 H2 B2 
]
C[Meatbun: yea
]
C[xhu98: That would work as well
]
C[Meatbun: your cut at r8 had me worried that i read wrong
]
C[Meatbun: had to reread it two more times after
]
C[xhu98: Yeah there was some aji
]
C[xhu98: But apparently just okay for Black :)
]
C[Meatbun: :)
]
C[Meatbun: same with your b2
]
C[xhu98: At endgame position
]
C[Meatbun: was certain you'd b3 instead of a4 at that point
]
C[xhu98: There was still a lot of aji in your territory, but not enough for me :D
]
C[Meatbun: lol
]
C[Meatbun: wish there was more in your territory
]
C[xhu98: I had a lot of aji as well :D
]
C[xhu98: B3 was gote, though
]
C[xhu98: I was eyeing O2
]
C[Meatbun: but 4 points
]
C[Meatbun: i meant you could have saved for after
]
C[xhu98: Oh yeah true
]
C[Meatbun: but yea closer than i though
]
C[Meatbun: let's go watch levvo bully someone
]
C[Meatbun: nm its already over
]
C[xhu98: Yeah, we shall wait for him to review
]
C[Meatbun: lol
]
C[herbie: Oh wow xD
]
C[LeandroSilva: Good game.
]
C[herbie: Too confusing for sure xD
