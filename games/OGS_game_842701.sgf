C[KoBa: does black have a large advantage?
]
;W[kf]
;B[fq]
C[Mikasa: Yes
]
C[Mikasa: Black is winning by ..... honestly quite a lot it will be devastatingly hard for whtie to win this game now :(!

C[pathogenix: The exchange from move 26 seemed like it was very bad for white
]
C[Mikasa: Yes
]
C[Mikasa: That was not a proper way to live
]
C[Mikasa: But, it was an interesting idea
]
C[Mikasa: Normally white will play Q8 instead of R10
]
C[Mikasa: So R10 was an "interesting" move
]
;W[ji]
;B[qg]
C[ardent: I don't think that it's so bad for white
]
;W[rg]
;B[rf]
C[mark5000: I heard Kim Seong Ryong 9p say that R6 is itself an overplay in san ren sei.
]
;W[dh]
C[Mikasa: If you mean "now" then no its not bad for white anymore :)
]
C[Mikasa: White build the upper left side very nicely
]
C[Mikasa: But, I am quite sure white did not like his result
]
C[Mikasa: And, can't see anyone who would have wanted white as the previous position unless they like to die xD
]
;B[dm]
C[Mikasa: But, now white is doing much better and the upper left is becoming developed well but I don,t think black will let it go that easy
]
C[Mikasa: Looking at the lower right just looks utterly painful
]
C[Mikasa: There is almost no way to invade it and its worth about lets see...
]
C[Mikasa: about 45-50
]
C[Mikasa: Whites could be equaly as big if he can make it solid territory but its really hard for black to ivnade that area as well 
]
C[Mikasa: E5 looks REALLY painful for whtie he can't let black get E5
]
C[Mikasa: But, I have no clue how to respond either :)
]
;W[cn]
C[Mikasa: Ah as black I would still want E5 here
]
C[Mikasa: But, I don't know if thats a good move or not now 
]
C[Mikasa: Even though its really good shape
]
;B[dr]
C[pathogenix: This corner looks painful, too
]
C[Mikasa: Yeah
]
C[Mikasa: pathogenix: what is the T?
]
C[pathogenix: I timed out in a correspondence game
]
C[pathogenix: Which sucks because I was winning :D
]
C[Mikasa: Oh bad! :D!
]
C[pathogenix: too busy programming
]
C[Mikasa: Hahaha should pay more attention :)!
]
C[pathogenix: As a stupid 6k, I'd want to trade this corner and attack from aboce
]
C[pathogenix: maybe you can make the game even from that direction
]
C[Mikasa: Haha
]
C[Mikasa: The corner is to big to give up unfortunately
]
C[Mikasa: Especially with the size that blacks corner is
]
C[pathogenix: I did say I was stupid
]
C[Mikasa: xD I don't think your stupid
]
C[pathogenix: That's the nicest thing anyone's said to me all week
]
C[Mikasa: xD
]
C[pathogenix: but if you try to live here, won't black just carry on solidifying the lower half of the board
]
C[Mikasa: I don't know if I had anythign nice said to me this week haha
]
;W[cl]
C[Mikasa: Yes
]
C[pathogenix: Well, you're pretty, and you're talented, and you're a vital part of the community
]
C[pathogenix: how's that?
]
C[Mikasa: Unfortateunly if white plays c3 and just lives black will win for sure
]
C[Mikasa: Awwww thank you ^^!
]
C[pathogenix: so you have to fight from the other side, right?
]
C[pathogenix: Or quit
]
C[Mikasa: That wasn't sarcasm though right xD?
]
C[LinuxGooo: hey, whats going here ? *laugh*
]
C[Mikasa: Well, white will defenitly try something 
]
C[pathogenix: I'm never sarcastic, Mikasa
]
C[Mikasa: He won't just "quit" :)
]
C[LinuxGooo: am I on a boat with "fishing for compliments" ??
]
C[pathogenix: Except on says that end in a y
]
C[jbrush: lol
]
C[pathogenix: You're pretty too, LinuxGooo
]
C[LinuxGooo: patho, I know that :-)
]
C[Mikasa: hahaha
]
C[Mikasa: LinuxGooo: is such a pretty princess :(
]
C[LinuxGooo: :-)
]
C[Mikasa: So lucky
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm.... I didnt know that I am a princess... thats new for me
]
C[Mikasa: C8 is an interesting move
]
C[pathogenix: I don't know what it means, but I like it
]
C[Mikasa: Black might try to play the cut at J12 before playing at the left side
]
C[pathogenix: Why now?
]
C[Mikasa: Because white wants black to play the ladder but the ladder runs straight into J13
]
C[Mikasa: Because black can't deal damage to the c6 c8 group right now
]
C[Mikasa: White has the ladder
]
C[Mikasa: This one favors white. From move 68: C7 B7 B6 B5 B8 A6 C9 
]
C[Mikasa: So black might try to create a ladder breaker using J12
]
C[Mikasa: NOte that S11 isn't fully alive yet if black cuts off J12
]
C[LinuxGooo: C6/C8 gives black a nice wall inside for centre play, isnt ?. From move 68: C7 B7 D6 C5 D8 C9 D9 D5 
]
;B[ih]
C[Mikasa: :)
]
C[Mikasa: Black will try to threaten whites S11 group
]
C[pathogenix: Are you doing something for Learn Go Week, Mikasa?
]
C[Mikasa: Since it is not alive and the whole bottom fo the board at the moment is blacks so black can happily attack this group
]
C[Mikasa: Yes
]
C[Mikasa: I am going to do a lecture on endgame
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm... there is just one eye yet
]
C[LinuxGooo: and white already run ou with M12-K11
]
C[Mikasa: Black does not plan to actually kill Q12 if it happends it just "happends"
]
C[Mikasa: He is just using this to attack C8
]
C[Mikasa: Interesting don't you think :D?
]
C[LinuxGooo: you mean your lecture topic ?
]
C[Mikasa: Using a stone almost half way across the board to attack the stones on the opposite side :)
]
C[Mikasa: My lecture topic is endgame :D
]
C[pathogenix: I love playing ladder breakers, but I wouldn't have considered the ladder from the lower left
]
C[pathogenix: dumb kyu
]
C[Mikasa: LeandroSilva brought up a really nice topic that I plan to do in the future as well
]
C[pathogenix: and if I did, my opponent would have wondered what the hell I was doing on the other side of the board :D
]
C[LinuxGooo: ah, you mean D7 - J12 ?
]
C[Mikasa: He said it would be cool to do a "timing" lecture
]
C[Mikasa: Like "when" toplay moves and when not to
]
C[pathogenix: On urgent/big or more subtle?
]
C[jbrush: (that would be great)
]
C[LinuxGooo: no, endgame lecture is more important for the beginners here on OGS
]
C[Mikasa: Yeah pathogenix 
]
C[Hurt: this subject would be great mikassa
]
C[pathogenix: Because urgent before big is one of the most important things to understand as a beginner
]
C[Mikasa: I really liked the idea but I also really liked the idea of endgame since people don't completely understand how important the end game is
]
C[pathogenix: and understanding what big means
]
C[LinuxGooo: good timing with big moves, important and urgent moves, sente and gote might be usefully too
]
C[Mikasa: So I chose end game for learn go week
]
C[Eyzero: have you made lectures before?
]
C[Mikasa: But, I will do the other topic as well as smoething for xhu98 go thingy he does
]
C[LinuxGooo: Doesnt make Endgame only sense if you played before a good middle game ?
]
C[pathogenix: Are you interested in lecturing, Eyzero?
]
C[Mikasa: I did once and it made everyone angry
]
C[Mikasa: LinuxGooo: was a participant in that lecture
]
C[Mikasa: It didn't go well :)
]
C[LinuxGooo: ah, you mean that "Fear in Go" teaching ?
]
C[Eyzero: @pathogenix, idk maybe
]
;W[dl]
C[Mikasa: Yeah LinuxGooo 
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm... 
]
C[pathogenix: Franzisa is the guy who knows things, Eyzero
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm
]
C[pathogenix: If you think you might be able to find time, we'd love to have you onboard
]
C[LinuxGooo: black's wall for centre play gone now
]
;B[ee]
C[Mikasa: Yeah I had to choose to do mineon the weekend for learn go week
]
C[Mikasa: Because of school >.<!
]
C[Eyzero: are these live lectures or text lectures?
]
C[pathogenix: I think text
]
;W[fd]
;B[ce]
C[LinuxGooo: audio feature will not work till the Go Learn week
]
C[pathogenix: But I'm wondering if I can find a way of doing voice
]
C[pathogenix: even if it means using Raidcall or something
]
C[Mikasa: Text I will be using the "comment" box in my lecture so all of the comments will be there afte I am done
]
C[LinuxGooo: you only could offer a Google Hangout and there the audio part
]
C[pathogenix: I don't know if I can teach without talking
]
C[pathogenix: LinuxGooo is on the right track
]
C[Mikasa: Haha pathogenix when you text teach :) do you talk at the same time?
]
C[pathogenix: Yeah
]
C[Mikasa: Hahaha so do I 
]
C[Mikasa: I hate it
]
C[LinuxGooo: skype and "group audio conference" cost money
]
C[pathogenix: I'm a programmer, I talk as I type
]
;W[df]
C[Mikasa: My mouthgets so tired and I am like... ok seriously I am typing why the hell am I talking to myself irl
]
C[pathogenix: I had a friend round earlier and she was all like "what does virtual void postcompile mean? Is that a sentence or what?"
]
;B[cc]
C[pathogenix: And I had to say "no, sorry, I was programming, ignore me"
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm... white will get a strong left side so it looks
]
;W[cb]
;B[dd]
C[Mikasa: If this black stones ilve
]
C[Mikasa: Black wins
]
C[LinuxGooo: but you should announce your audio teaching with Google hangout by time... not all have gmail account patho
]
C[pathogenix: yeah, E15 was aggressive
]
;W[bc]
;B[bd]
C[pathogenix: Couldn't white tenuki after C15?
]
C[LinuxGooo: as white I would be more scared of black's bottom side
]
C[pathogenix: I feel like white haggling over the top is irrelevant
]
C[Mikasa: Well, he could but black would live
]
C[Mikasa: But, point is he can't let black live no matter what
]
C[Mikasa: If black lives its over 
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm... M3 is still an option for white I think
]
C[Mikasa: M3 =ko threat :)
]
C[Mikasa: But, not life
]
C[pathogenix: Are you going to live there or run away, LinuxGooo ?
]
C[pathogenix: Neither looks attractive
]
C[Mikasa: Living = impossible - running = impossible xD
]
C[Mikasa: White would need M3 and then he would need black to tenuki to think about living
]
C[pathogenix: Before you play a stone: Can I live here? Can I run to safety? If the answer to the first is no, think hard, if the answer to the second is no, don't play
]
;W[jh]
C[LinuxGooo: if black overlays with M4 I'd live inside like a tumor in black's guts
]
C[Mikasa: Hahahaha yep yep pathogenix 
]
C[pathogenix: What if he kicks?
]
C[Mikasa: Woah K12 is a bit shocking
]
;B[cg]
C[LinuxGooo: you mean L3 or N3 ?
]
C[Mikasa: But, it's a "ok" choice
]
C[Mikasa: Because white can not avoid playing a ko with black
]
;W[ch]
C[Mikasa: SO white played K12 to remove the biggest threat on the board
]
C[Mikasa: So it was a smart chioce
]
C[Mikasa: But, I think it's impossible now to kill black :(
]
C[LinuxGooo: black was sleepy
]
C[LinuxGooo: 22 spectators
]
C[Mikasa: 23 on my csreen xD
]
C[LinuxGooo: I think, thats the highest number I ever seen in a game
]
C[Mikasa: *screen
]
C[LinuxGooo: 24 minus 2
]
C[Mikasa: Ah I heard a game a long time ago there was a game with like 40 specs
]
C[Mikasa: I can't remember who said that though xD
]
C[Mikasa: I also heard it was one of JeansebL games as well
]
C[LinuxGooo: mark, make the commentator pls
]
;B[cd]
C[Mikasa: If white plays B18 its "all or nothing"
]
C[LinuxGooo: why is Jean so slow ?
]
C[Mikasa: If D18 then I don't know how he plans to win @.@!
]
C[Mikasa: He is smart? xD
]
C[pathogenix: Another 6D 5D game has just started here: #842827
]
C[pathogenix: Man, OGS is awesome these days
]
;W[bb]
;B[ec]
;W[db]
;B[ed]
C[Mikasa: Yeah its getting a lot better
]
C[Mikasa: Oh another one
]
C[pathogenix: I remember when it was just me teasing crodgers and pestering matburt
]
;W[eb]
;B[fc]
C[sefo: but the 5d is not really 5d
]
C[Eyzero: id probalby go here. From move 21: G3 
]
C[Hurt: the problem is that hairyblob is a damn overpowered protoss
]
C[LinuxGooo: what is an overpowered protoss ? Is he one of the 3 musketieres ?
]
C[pathogenix: So would I, eyzero
]
C[Mikasa: Yeah Eyzero I would have played mroe calmer at the opening
]
C[Mikasa: The invasion looked way too early
]
;W[gd]
C[pathogenix: I don't know if that changes your opinion at all
]
;B[fb]
C[Mikasa: Ah white chose all or nothing :D!
]
;W[ea]
C[Eyzero: but black alive
]
C[Mikasa: Not yet
]
C[Mikasa: But it will most likely live but its defenitly not alive yet :D!
]
;B[hb]
;W[gc]
;B[gb]
;W[jb]
C[Mikasa: Looking hard for black to live now
]
C[LinuxGooo: K18 with H19 is so bad for black 
]
C[Eyzero: first feeling. From move 96: H15 
]
C[Eyzero: don't know the variations though
]
C[LinuxGooo: dont think, H15 works, white will come out
]
;B[ib]
C[LinuxGooo: white comes out with H15. From move 96: H15 G15 G14 H16 J16 H14 J15 F14 G13 F13 H17 F15 H13 K14 K17 L17 J18 K16 J17 J19 H19 K19 L18 F19 M18 N17 M17 M16 
]
C[Mikasa: Hm white has to K17 here
]
;W[kb]
C[LinuxGooo: white comes out with H15 (2). From move 96: H15 G15 G14 H16 J16 H14 J15 F14 G13 F13 H17 F15 H13 K14 K17 L17 J18 K16 J17 J19 H19 K19 L18 F19 M18 N17 M17 M16 L19 H12 G12 J11 K15 L15 K19 
]
;B[dg]
C[Eyzero: linuxgooo there are some mistakes in your first variation
]
C[LinuxGooo: yeah, thats why I am only DDK :-(
]
;W[eg]
C[LinuxGooo: so teach me the right path pls :-)
]
C[Eyzero: it's pretty complicated and I didn't fully read it out 
]
;B[bg]
C[LinuxGooo: yes, dammed GO.... so complicated :-)
]
C[LinuxGooo: get headages because of some stones
]
C[Mikasa: This is game over
]
;W[ef]
;B[fa]
C[LinuxGooo: why ?
]
C[KoBa: "it's only a wooden board and stones with two colours, how hard can it be"
]
C[Mikasa: Because white lost all his territory
]
C[Mikasa: This is not only painful to the territory of thegame but also the morale of the player
]
;W[ho]
C[Mikasa: Since white couldhave simply played D18 and black would live
]
C[LinuxGooo: white has left side, top side with with two corner, can play centre as doing now with H5, can survive right side.... 
]
C[Mikasa: INstead he played B18 let black run wild in his territory and black lived as well
]
;B[iq]
C[Mikasa: I would have played this way of course as well though :) I wouldn't have wanted black to live
]
C[Mikasa: I just mean that he chose the "all or nothing" move
]
C[LinuxGooo: greedyness is punished in Go very often
]
;W[jn]
C[Mikasa: White trying to build n the center but it is not enough :(
]
;B[fo]
C[Mikasa: Black around 90 >.< white around 50
]
;W[fn]
;B[eo]
C[LinuxGooo: black a pain in the a*** for white ?. From move 107: F7 G6 H7 G7 G8 E7 E8 H8 H9 J8 J7 G9 F8 H10 J9 K8 G10 J10 K9 K10 L9 L10 L8 L11 J11 H11 H12 G11 F9

C[KillerDucky: I thought it was already generous saying white can't do anything around M3 or R3
]
C[MikeKindOfThinksGoIsOk: i'll change it back soon
]
C[Mikasa: Defenitly white can't doanything around those areas KillerDucky

C[LinuxGooo: "private teacher" means, you dont have a living of it, its "non commercial"

C[lemmata: black by 8-ish I think... If the game is almost done like this, they often go to counting just by momentum.
