C[macelee: hi

;W[dp]
;B[dd]
;W[qp]
;B[jd]
C[RobertT: k16 very odd
]
;W[cf]
C[RobertT: usually one of these 2. From move 4: 
]
;B[pk]
C[Shakti: indeed, never seen it in progame
]
C[RobertT: now invasion is very easy. From move 7: P16 
]
C[RobertT: k16 will never be played i pro games
]
;W[oc]
C[RobertT: now white is a lot of room to live. From move 8: 
]
C[RobertT: k16 is too far to defend the 3-4 point
]
;B[ef]
C[RobertT: another strange moe...
]
;W[cc]
C[Shakti: very freeflowing fuseki
]
;B[cd]
;W[dc]
C[Claint: ok, now I cannot understand this game at all
]
C[RobertT: b opening is very bad
]
;B[ec]
C[Shakti: it's hard to find a good choice of joseki for top right, N17 imposible now, i guess must Q17?
]
;W[eb]
;B[bd]
;W[fc]
;B[ed]
C[RobertT: this direction choice makes no sense for black
]
C[RobertT: it is very hard to build left side
]
;W[gb]
C[Claint: yeah when white moved in, i thought black would block the top and it would be good for him.
]
;B[cn]
C[RobertT: better than game. From move 10: D17 C16 N17 
]
C[RobertT: but e14 is still out of place
]
;W[ge]
C[RobertT: d3. From move 19: C10 
]
;B[di]
C[RobertT: w last move is a mistake
]
;W[lc]
C[RobertT: very hard to attack k16 because it is so light
]
C[Shakti: i think he feared black may make some moyo later
]
;B[fq]
;W[fp]
C[RobertT: as long as black doesn't run k16 out, b made very little from g15 exchange
]
;B[gp]
;W[fo]
;B[em]
;W[gq]
;B[op]
C[RobertT: I dont understand e7 either
]
C[RobertT: seems better for black. From move 26: E3 D3 J3 C5 D6 E4 
]
;W[hq]
;B[qq]
;W[rq]
;B[pq]
;W[qm]
C[Shakti: never seen it before
]
C[Shakti: e7 that is
]
;B[lq]
;W[pi]
;B[rk]
;W[qf]
C[RobertT: thats because it isn't a move
]
;B[pe]
C[RobertT: it isn't possible, it is just bad
]
;W[pf]
C[RobertT: closest I've seen is this. From move 26: E3 D3 D7 
]
;B[nd]
C[RobertT: but tenuki without e3 is just bad
]
;W[le]
;B[nc]
;W[om]
;B[nk]
;W[mm]
C[RobertT: later this group is alive. From move 43: O18 N18 P18 N17 S17 
]
;B[oi]
;W[oh]
;B[ni]
;W[pj]
;B[jf]
C[RobertT: push is huge. From move 51: P10 
]
C[Claint: I was looking for the shape move against that push
]
;W[oj]
C[RobertT: the way with the best shape is this way. From move 50: P10 
]
C[Shakti: you just need to let 2 go and keep the group below under pressure
]
C[RobertT: but it leaves forcing moves
]
C[RobertT: if you dont want the forcing moves then 
]
;B[ok]
C[Shakti: but usually, getting shape broken like this is very bad
]
C[RobertT: can bamboo. From move 50: P9 
]
;W[nj]
C[RobertT: the first way i showed is more common because it gives better shape
]
C[Claint: yeah i didn't like either bamboo or the connect so I kept looking
]
C[RobertT: this was horrible for black
]
;B[ro]
;W[mk]
C[RobertT: if I was black I would resign this game and move on to the next one on principle
]
C[RobertT: and cry at my shapes
]
;B[rm]
;W[ql]
;B[qn]
;W[qk]
;B[mf]
C[RobertT: time to take the corner
]
;W[nb]
;B[lf]
C[RobertT: lol
]
;W[pb]
C[RobertT: black wants dame instead
]
;B[of]
C[Shakti: b4 now should be enough
]
;W[ke]
;B[je]
;W[gg]
;B[pg]
C[RobertT: it is

]
;W[kc]
C[RobertT: ..
]
;B[kd]
;W[od]
;B[oe]
;W[md]
C[RobertT: just here. From move 79: N16 
]
;B[ne]
C[RobertT: black had nothing
]
;W[me]
;B[jc]
C[RobertT: connect made no sense. From move 84: N15 
]
;W[jb]
;B[kf]
C[Shakti: i see now ways anymore
]
;W[lb]
C[Shakti: to complicate the game
]
C[Shakti: no*
]
;B[jh]
;W[ng]
;B[og]
;W[mi]
;B[qh]
C[RobertT: yay, free profit of the right side. From move 94: Q12 O12 R12 O14 J11 H12 K10 
]
;W[rh]
C[Shakti: i see nothing working for b here
]
C[Shakti: except some reduction
]
;B[ri]
C[Shakti: hmm
]
C[RobertT: double hane. From move 97: 
]
;W[ph]
;B[qi]
C[RobertT: this works for black
]
C[RobertT: or not. From move 99: S13 S8 S16 S17 S15 R17 T14 
]
C[RobertT: d4. From move 99: S13 S8 S16 S17 S15 R18 T14 O14 K11 
]
;W[nf]
;B[mg]
;W[nh]
;B[re]
;W[ig]
;B[ji]
C[RobertT: can run faster. From move 104: K10 
]
C[Shakti: if black lives, he is not too bad shape
]
;W[hj]
;B[ib]
C[Shakti: territorial lead
]
;W[ka]
C[RobertT: w will gain from this attack
]
C[RobertT: or at least should
]
;B[jk]
;W[il]
C[RobertT: maybe would have been better to push b closer. From move 105: K9 J10 G10 J9 G8 K8 D9 
]
;B[ik]
;W[hk]
;B[jl]
C[RobertT: now harder to use this on the left side, w will only gain in h5 area
]
;W[jm]
C[Shakti: may need to kill this
]
C[Shakti: he needs to gain more than a few center
]
;B[ii]
C[Shakti: if he can get M4 and black must tenuki maybe
]
;W[hi]
C[Shakti: but always risk
]

;W[on]
;B[pn]
;W[mn]
C[Claint: N6 
]
C[RobertT: dont understand why w was thinking there
]
C[RobertT: there was only 1 possible move
]
;B[no]
C[Claint: black should have played it
]
;W[nm]
C[RobertT: it didn't work
]
C[RobertT: w is alive so black is playing dame. From move 178: N6 Q6 
]
C[RobertT: what black played was better
]
C[Claint: hmmm ok
]
C[Claint: you are right.
]
;B[el]
;W[fl]
C[RobertT: that last move was small
]
;B[en]
C[RobertT: p2 is 8 points, b2 is 8 points b18 is 6 points p5 is 6 points
]
C[RobertT: e6 was 2 points
]
C[Shakti: b2 more?
]
C[Claint: b2 huge
]
C[RobertT: p2 and b2 same size point wise but p2 better because probem is white gest both p2 and p5
]
C[Shakti: b2 has senter or reverse sente properties
]
C[RobertT: I counted that
]
;W[fn]
C[RobertT: the difference in points if w plays or black plays
]
;B[sd]
;W[sa]
C[RobertT: if black gets b2. From move 186: B2 A9 D1 E1 C1 E2

]
C[RobertT: was thinking this. From move 237: F17 F18 F14 F13 T15 B15 A15 A13 C15 B14 
]
C[RobertT: but

C[Pempu: Thank you
]
C[macelee: thanks
]
C[Pempu: I think I should die in the middle
]
C[macelee: it is hard to kill
]
C[Pempu: time pressure on both of us also
]
C[macelee: yes
]
C[macelee: if I did not lose the O9 stones
]
C[Pempu: yeah it was weird
]
C[macelee: might be enough to win
]
C[Pempu: I thought you woul answer my peep
]
C[macelee: N2 stones are smaller
]
C[macelee: I was rather upset because I should have peeped there first
]
C[Pempu: :)
]
C[macelee: :)
]
C[Pempu: bye
]
C[macelee: bye
]
C[Pempu: Just a demo drawing.. From move 36: 
]
C[Pempu: Scroll up the kibitz to see variations
]
C[Pempu: Hover mouse over the variation to quickly look at it. Clicking it let's you play them out in analyze mode.
]
C[RobertT: you were fine
]
C[RobertT: white should not have given up s12 area
]
C[Claint: very unconventional opening by black
]
C[RobertT: cut was bad
]
C[RobertT: also w lost a lot in endgame
]
C[Claint: I was perplexed at the beginning.
]
C[RobertT: ya, you ignored a 1 point move and ended up losing 10 lol
]
C[RobertT: actually more
]
C[Claint: o9 stones and b3
]
C[RobertT: like 13 point difference
]
C[RobertT: both openings made me sad
]
C[RobertT: also attack on top right
]
C[RobertT: b had a chance to make eyes but decided to save 2 stones instead
]
C[RobertT: then white decided to take dame cut instead of living
]
C[RobertT: then w only got a couple points in h5 area from the attack lol
]
C[RobertT: *cries*
]
C[dfunkt: I hope you guys are getting all that... RobertT is sad and disappointed.  do better next time! <jk>
