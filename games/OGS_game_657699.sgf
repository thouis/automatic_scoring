C[DeathTheKid101: what about the bottom left.
]
;B[gs]
;W[ia]
;B[jj]
C[Mikasa: Bottom left white is alive
]
C[DeathTheKid101: he could still get that.
]
C[Mikasa: D8 and D6 is seki
]
;W[ij]
;B[fs]
;W[ds]
C[Mikasa: No no bottom left is seki
]
;B[gh]
C[Mikasa: It is when both player's can not play a move to eachother so the points become null
]
;W[dc]
;B[ed]
C[DeathTheKid101: but the bottom left. could still be taken.

C[hglee: thanks

]
C[hglee: do i win?
]
C[hglee: hi mikasa
]
C[kde_ko: I am surprised.
]
C[kde_ko: u did win
]
C[hglee: i am surprisde too
]
C[Mikasa: There is no way to take the bottom left @DeathTheKid101
]
C[Mikasa: yes if white passes... but the point of the game is that both players get a turn
]
C[Mikasa: Hello hglee!
]
C[Mikasa: This instead. From move 183: D5 
]
C[Mikasa: Hello kde_ko
]
C[DeathTheKid101: maybe but to me when stones are like that. there is still a way to take it.
]
C[Mikasa: Yeah you won by .5
]
C[Mikasa: kde_ko could have killed you though
]
C[Mikasa: Yes if the opponent was a lot weaker... but the point is for me to show you the correct path @Death
]
C[Mikasa: This move first for black. From move 190: E8 
]
C[Mikasa: This atari is a very big liberty taker
]
C[DeathTheKid101: i know mikasa 
]
C[Mikasa: If black had played E8 he would have won there
]
C[Mikasa: But if white plays D5 instead of E4 than he win 
]
C[Mikasa: It was exciting to watch though
]
C[DeathTheKid101: but i never think there is no possible way til i see it.
]
C[Mikasa: Too bad I came at middle-ending
]
C[Mikasa: Play it out on another board DeathTheKid101 there is no shame in trying it on another board :) I think it is simple so it is something you should check on another board to see for yourself
]
C[Mikasa: Hm...
]
C[Mikasa: hglee you are almost 3d now!
]
C[Mikasa: I am 4d now :)!
]
C[DeathTheKid101: mikasa, thanks for the offer but im good. im still inexperince so ill listen to you this time.
]
C[Mikasa: Well, ok I think you should have it helps improvement to do things like that
]
C[Mikasa: But, oh well :(
]
