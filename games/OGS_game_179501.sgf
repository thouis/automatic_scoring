C[Uberdude: Strange, r8 is practically as solid and a few points more, though given how the game went to difference really.

C[Uberdude: You're normally supposed to s13 here. Even if I get another move on top side (I think I was planning on o16), it's not mine yet.

C[Uberdude: I expect this is bad as it helps you build moddile, should f15 perhaps. I didn't like g16 though.

C[Uberdude: This is probably rather soft and I should just plonk in a stone at m9 or so and challenge you to kill it.

C[Uberdude: As I didn't really build anything of my own here but made your moyo into territory, and your UL not 100% dead yet.
]
;B[kq]
C[Uberdude: I suppose I should b13 to make sure you are dead, but then you get m3 in pretty much sente for p2. I didn't think I was ahead enough o play safe like that, but I think I must be given that I won despite you living in UL which was huge.

C[Uberdude: I expect you are winning now as I gave you the middle for the kill, but you got both. Neverthless, a lot of yose to go.

C[Uberdude: You could try to get c6 in sente, if I ignore and n14 b7 is a huge ko, really difficult decision for me as stuff can die whereas n14 just points.

C[Uberdude: Read =) This becomes a textbook tsumego. After this died I counted me ahead 3.5 points and this lost at least 5 points over n18 sente yose. So losing move.
