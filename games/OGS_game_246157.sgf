C[ywhuang: This is an interesting move. I've only seen this in a few games but I think it works out fine for white here.
]
C[Rathbone: Yes, I played there because there seemed to be potential to make territory on the left side.

C[Rathbone: I'm thinking this should have been at F17; my thinking at the time was to make sure that both groups were clearly alive.

C[ywhuang: Very sharp move. The ko decides the game essentially
]
C[Rathbone: yeah, i thought I might have more ko threats with the upper right hand corner and lower right to live

C[ywhuang: I don't think black can win if yields at N2

C[ywhuang: G2 seems better, doesn't it?

C[ywhuang: I am not quite sure why you played here. Why not keep using the ko threats in the top right corner?
]
C[Rathbone: I think it protects the connection since I no longer have 2 eyes on the bottom.  i.e. black e6, white e7 and then black can't f7?
]
C[ywhuang: Yes black can cut if white doesn't play F8. However E6 and G4 are miai. For example, white can play the ko threat at R18. If Black ignores (J1), then W S19-B F1-W E6. Black's loss in the corner is bigger than the gain at the bottom.
]
C[Rathbone: yes, I see it now

C[ywhuang: I think white should connect at O12 here. You still have a couple of ko threats
]
C[Rathbone: yes and white o10 should be at n11 then there is another ko at m10
