C[KlausP: Black can probably win with b9 here. After b9 Black can answer the throw in with b7.
]
C[KyuT: I thought that was a ko that I can't win. B9 C9 B7 A9 B6 B5 then quite a few variations but I see either ko with white takes first (if Black A7 White throws in A6 next move most variations) or if Black starts the Ko with A8 then White has a valid threat at G2 (that starts another ko that black can't win). I could easily have missed something though, it's pretty complex
]
C[KlausP: It is no Ko and not complex. :)
If w takes, b wins with c6, capturing in a ladder or net.

C[KyuT: Haha, I definitely overthink these games...
