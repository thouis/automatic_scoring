C[Uberdude: Nice feeling. If you played p15 which feels honte-ish, or p14, then I was planning on funky style o7 q7 (maybe you can resist) o9.

C[Uberdude: I wanted to o16 but seems too thin. Plus this shape looks awesome!

C[Uberdude: So many funky jumps!
]
;W[ke]
C[Uberdude: I'm not sure this is good, but I was continuing the funk. Maybe I should just play c15, I doubt you can kill, just loosely seal in sente. There's such a lot of thinness such as o10.

C[Uberdude: Fixes in sente, but leaves bad aji =)

C[Uberdude: Why here rather than more usual b15 or b16 or c16? This is usually bad with f17 in place already. You didn't fear fight with k16 and m12 support?

C[Uberdude: This move seems like it's trying too hard to be a clever probe, but is actually just a bad move. The plan is to get c11 answer before inducing running at g15? But unless you can play c8 later it didn't gain anything, and actually weakned the c14 stones as you can't make eyes with b11 or c12. You always have nice yose at b8.
]
C[Uberdude: c8 -> c9

C[Uberdude: I wonder if I can play e13 to clean up the left. I thought probably you can then kill me on the right but n9 is quite thin and maybe I have some flexible way to sacrifice the group and live in the top right corner or something like o10 to break out. Or even just tenuki again to j7 and invite you to play another move to complete the kill and then I j10.

C[Uberdude: This surprised me, I expect you to block the side and then I would o13. Probably better if it works, but the aji is bad.

C[Uberdude: Taking the corner in sente seems fine for black.

C[Uberdude: Nice feeling again, I wanted to j7.

C[Uberdude: Did you think these were dead? This living seemed to get me back in the game. But first I think I should play p3 p4 o3 q2 sente. I didn't because I had dreams of doing something in your corner with answering n2 at r3, but due to s9 strength it actually just seems to die so better to bulk up the lower side a bit first. I should have found a time to probe that corner, you got it big and solid too easily.

C[Uberdude: This move probably should have been your sente, say before n5.
]
C[Uberdude: But maybe it's not 100% sente, but it's painful for white to get it as it's more related to the life of white's group that black's.

C[Uberdude: When I played this I thought it was a reverse sente, but black here is not actually sente as white's answer at p10 is sente. Still big though.
]
C[Uberdude: As I gained a lot in yose here are my yose notes, maybe you find them interesting:
h12 = 3 reverse sente
P3 = 2 sente
A8 = 5.66
D18 ~5.5
D7 = 2 reverse sente
M4 = 1.1 rs
K18 = 4.5
Q13 = 4 rs

C[Uberdude: I was bluffing/kiai, you should f7, it is bigger. Even though I capture n18 stones in sente for life of your group, the trade of you getting g8 benefits black by a few points.
]
;W[fm]
C[Uberdude: So I gain a point as I would have answered f7 at f8 and then connected e8 after l19.
