C[integer: now that you're here also up for live games :)

C[integer: most of the time i'm in chat

C[betterlife: no bit busy, was answering emails

;W[cd]
C[integer: ok, no problem

C[integer: how are you liking this go server btw
]
C[integer: compared to ogs, say

C[betterlife: i like the layout of OGS more
]
C[betterlife: somehow the buttons, fonts sizes and boxes are bit unproportionl for my estetical feeling
]
C[betterlife: but to tell you the trouth after topazg quit the new guys didn't do a good job imo 
]
C[betterlife: actually i run into disliking dmg ... especially his attitude ...
]
C[betterlife: oh nice! the conditional moves are really a cool feature :) just used it for the first time, let's see if you follow ...

C[integer: yeah this site can be a bit overwhelming, navigation is harder
]
C[integer: and if you pick the plain themed stones, they don't "hug" nicely, but there looks like there's a 1px space between the black stones etc. very annoying
]
C[integer: but i really like that it's a "complete" go server, with both live and correspondence, and it's not java, which sometimes bugs out in xmonad on linux
]
;W[dp]
C[betterlife: i changed the theme but not yet the stones, sometimes it's hard to figure out what's wrong with the graphics, like what you mention with the 1 pixel for not hugging stones :)
]
C[betterlife: ah there is not changing stones feature yet ...
]
C[betterlife: but as you say it's really a cool place here, java seems to be dead for end users, i especially like the sound / micro feature here, this is very promissing and i guess soon all browsers will allow this feature to work
]
C[integer: no changing stones feature? you can change the stone theme, preferences -> themes -> black/white stones etc
]
;B[md]
C[betterlife: ah cool, for some reason i didn't see the registers. Now i have flat stones 0_o

C[betterlife: for a moment i thought that this OGS message is a bad joke but luckily it looks more that Nova has taken OGS than OGS Nova (at least i hope this!!)
]
C[betterlife: *taken over

C[integer: yeah

C[integer: they've taken over

C[integer: thanks!
]
C[betterlife: thank you for the game
]
C[betterlife: an ohter one?
]
C[integer: sure
]
C[integer: should play psycho go sometime
]
C[integer: again
]
C[integer: if there was a way to play where undos were automatic
]
C[betterlife: you mean when the move is not good?!
]
C[integer: no, where if i don't accept a move, i can undo it automatically and make it your turn again
]
C[integer: maybe if there were some sort of "open review" game where both players can modify the tree
]
C[integer: instead of just the controller
]
C[betterlife: ah ok
]
C[integer: but just wishful thinking
]
C[betterlife: i see but could get caotic ...
]
C[integer: can only veto one move right?
]
C[betterlife: in the review?
]
C[betterlife: i've never tried it
