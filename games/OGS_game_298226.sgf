C[Uberdude: The opening of this game was near identical to a Lee Sedol vs Lee Changho game commented by An Younggil at http://gogameguru.com/commentary-sedol-lee-changho-lee-prices-information-cup/

C[cook777: I didn't think you normally want jump in like this.
]
C[Uberdude: The old theory is to split at r10, but then f17 c14 r13 r7 k16 gives black a nice position, so this approach is the new style.
]
;B[pi]
;W[md]
C[Uberdude: Another modern move. The meaning of this is if q14 r17 q17 r16 then this is further from black's wall than o17 or o16 and thus an improvement for white.

C[Uberdude: It's sente and solid, but the exchange is slightly better for white as p16 n16 makes perfect shape, but q11 is a bit odd.

C[cook777: I would have thought it a little early. hmm maybe its because it not an actually an invasion? (thinking I must got something wrong in my thinking.)
]
C[Uberdude: Maybe it is early, I don't know. But it's more a reduction than an invasion (if black m3 I will p5). In the pro game white simply played f17 and allowed black to grow at f5 in sente for d9, and then black came in at b15. But if instead of b15 black grew at one of the move's suggested in Younggil's commentary (p5, g9, n14) I would find it hard to deal with the black moyo so decided to reduce now.
]
C[devariot: This is a good way to mark out and suggest invasion.. there is also alternative to take the center if "things goes bad"?
]
;B[nn]
C[Uberdude: Nice
]
C[devariot: I think this move kill off quite a few possibilities in terms of move..
]
;W[lq]
C[devariot: @Uberdude: I would have played K5.. what do you think?
]
C[Uberdude: I think k5 would let black have too much territory: I don't mind him getting m3 territory if I can then play p5 to reduce right, but now black has o6 if I let him have lower side territory too he has got both areas and all I get is a weak reducing group.

C[Uberdude: I think this is a big mistake, and I should n4. If then black o2 breaking through at o5 looks ok, so black o5 and then white could p2/n2 and has a ko threat with l4.
]
;B[mq]
;W[nr]
;B[lp]
C[Uberdude: I had somehow missed this obvious move and only expected n4. Maybe I could have played l4 atari before o2 connect to stop it, but probably black ignores.

C[Uberdude: White lived with a decent sized corner, but in gote and black cut off m5 and is very thick. I thought it was good for black as the right side looks almost like territory now, and black has centre potential.
]
;B[cf]
C[Uberdude: At this point I wished I had played f17 like Lee Sedol instead of m5. Black won't exchange f5 for d9 now as f5 is not needed to cover h3 gap.
]

C[Uberdude: Playing this immediately after the corner joseki is a bit weird as it's smaller that a corner joseki so means black got tedomari in the opening. But I couldn't decide on a central reduction point. m10? f5 doesn't threaten much with k2 strong. So I decided to try to make the top points and induce fixing c14 aji.

C[Uberdude: Painful getting pushed low.
]
C[devariot: Wow I would have miss this B13 if I am playing.. That's something I learnt here..
]
C[Uberdude: If you play b14 then black will c12 atari and d11 is damaged. This does connect, but is making the best of a bad situation: it is has shape weakness and is not many points.
]
;B[dh]
;W[ci]
;B[ei]
C[Uberdude: These last 2 moves surprised me, I simply expected f10 jump. But they are nice and thick and even made my left side group not so strong which was a rather nasty surprise.

C[Uberdude: Stretching things to the max
]
;B[bf]
C[Uberdude: Annoying good move, I was expecting c9 and then I get b14 (in sente if black's trying to kill me)
]
;W[df]
;B[gi]
C[Uberdude: This threat seems to help white a bit. m5 is not totally useless as it makes the ladder! Maybe d5 instead? It's usually an aji keshi, but here it doesn't even look so bad as helps e9. The ko is very light for black. Can white kill with f7 after winning ko? d5 threat would interfere with that.
]

C[Uberdude: So painful to submit and make e17 sente which loses my huge e18 (or f18 for sente).

C[cook777: Why would B play B7 to just have you cut at C7 just so he coudl just leave it?
]
C[Uberdude: I assume black misread here and thought b9 c9 a8 d8 d9 ko, but I have a tesuji to kill it: b9 d10 e10 d8.
]
;B[gp]
;W[go]
;B[fo]
;W[ep]
;B[gn]
C[Uberdude: I was rather happy black went for the trade, as if he connected at g3 (or h4) I don't think I can kill as black can build an eye at f11. Maybe he just played simply as ahead.
]
;W[gq]
C[Uberdude: This is a mistake, I should first exchange d10 for e10 (which is needed to resist b9), because then later I am more flexible so can sacrifice the h13 stones.
]
;B[ho]
;W[fr]
C[Uberdude: Wanted to h3, but then although f3 is dead, black can probably use the aji to live in the corner.
]
;B[ii]
C[Uberdude: Now I bitterly regretted not exchanging d10 earlier, as then I could j10 to sacrifice h13 and live in the centre.
]
;W[hj]
;B[jk]
C[Uberdude: Why not j12 first? I can't tenuki to j9 myself as then black can b9. Well I guess I don't die with j12 j9 b9 d10 d9 e10 h12 (black can't f10) f10 g12 m9. Black capturing b8 is pretty huge as the lower left gets thin, and h13 too. This should be enough though as the game has been hard for white for ages.

C[Uberdude: Big surprise
]
;W[lg]
;B[jm]
C[Uberdude: Seems rather soft: I didn't think white could jump in to k7 as black has j8 peep and cut, g7 not really sente for white.
]
;W[ki]
;B[kj]
;W[mh]
C[Uberdude: This is pretty huge sente, now I started to have some hope I can win with excellent yose. But still it was pretty depressing how easily black made a huge centre and side compared to how much effort it took to make my territory on the left.
]
;B[mi]
;W[nh]
;B[ni]
;W[oh]
;B[oi]
C[Uberdude: q12 is better as same for points (lose p10, gain r12) and the p11 weakness doesn't seem to actually do anything. This way s16 is more sente for white as saving r14 is sente due to the q13 cut, which wouldn't be the case with q12.

;B[re]

C[Uberdude: Gote instead of sente due to b14 making e17 atari.

C[Uberdude: When I chose f18 instead of m2 I had actually miscalculated and though e19 was sente immediately, instead of as it really is only with dame filled. So instead of being 12 vs n2's 10 points, it's 10.5, but with n2 black got tedomari so maybe I should m2 instead of f18 and then let black get g18 in sente by answering at h19. Problem is then black has sente for the next drop in temperature so could get j6 which is a pretty big reverse sente.

C[Uberdude: This is not 100% sente

C[Uberdude: Deceptively big.
]
C[Uberdude: At this point I didn't know who would win; it's a half point game, but probably black's.
]
;B[ch]
C[Uberdude: Losing this liberty makes f10 bigger as if ignored I take the eye in sente and h6 is 2 points for later too. So maybe black shouldn't play it unless he's going to f10 after. But it's also 1.5 points reverse sente for white. It's similar to how I won't n1 until I will p3 after as it lets black take p3 for 1.3 pts in sente.
]
;W[bh]
;B[ke]
C[Uberdude: Whereas this is definitely a good sente, I was considering this instead of o1 but it's a little smaller.
]
;W[le]
;B[do]
C[Uberdude: The game losing tesuji: it's a clever move, but not the biggest. Instead of o1 I was considering e6 as it is a nice thick move that fixes some aji inside with the f3 stone should black get h1, and also allows the white push at k5 which is otherwise short of liberties. But aji doesn't matter now, counting does, and compared to white e6 this destroys a point at c5, half a point at  d6, and also a point at c4 (even if white gets h1). So 2.5 pts. f19 is 3. In the game black also gave white half a point at h9 so this became a 2 point move.
]
;W[eo]
;B[dn]
;W[en]
;B[gm]
C[Uberdude: g8 is better as then j9 is black's privilege so white doesn't have half a point at h9. That half point is actually worth a bit more as it means black l14 is simply 1 point instead of having a further 1 point followup at m14 to make n15 dame.

C[Uberdude: Black tricked himself again with d5. Probably thought this was 3 points instead of 2 as it means white can't answer e3 at d3 so when f7 is filled white needs to fix inside. But in fact even if white gets h1 I need to fix inside once f7 and j1 liberties filled: d3 e3 d2 then e2 c3 lives, or c2 e2 f3 f1 white dies.
]
;W[gs]
;B[is]
;W[ms]
C[Uberdude: This is 2.3 pts, but more like 3 as black would probably win the ko, I didn't count threats exactly.

;B[ls]
;W[oq]
;B[if]
;W[ig]
;B[fj]
;W[il]
C[Uberdude: The correct timing. Should not do it before black f10, because if white gets f10 in gote and then e12 to take eye in sente then black might play h6 to save g5 h4 points which would require fixing at k8 after white j7.

C[cook777: Could W done something here? (I was going to ask about W next move but I see F7 lib now so I guess your D2 was a dame move.)
]
C[Uberdude: Black is alive by double ko here with c19 d18 b18 a18 a19 b19 threat answer a19 c18, but once the outside dame are filled black is in atari so has to spend one move inside.
]
;W[dr]
C[Uberdude: When black played c4 I was a little scared that he could live inside with c2 instead of simply forcing a defensive move after f7, but he can't.
