C[davos: I kind of regret this move. In hindsight I think D7 is better even though that gives white territory. Black has gotten territory too at the bottom right, so he should not mind too much about that.
]
;W[dn]
C[Uberdude: As we discussed hard to judge this one. I later asked JeffChang 9d about it and he said the L7 area is more important. If b cuts at c5 it is not so bad for white as still some aji and plays a move like c13. So instead something like j8 h9 m8 to get into that nice box shape territory b is building.

C[Uberdude: I was afraid of k8 here, it might be crude but w's shape is so bad even if pushes into b area. k5 would then become sente for k6 which means w loses the j4 eye.
]
C[davos: Yes, K8 looks better.

C[Uberdude: I was happy as d6 is now a good move.
]
C[davos: Yes, The bottomright looks good for black, but his group at the bottomleft feels too uneasy. Black has played a bit too greedy.

C[Uberdude: I think this is a mistake as I was happy to fix my bad aji at q12.
]
C[davos: If black doesn't play this, white has N15. I don't think black should allow that. I think black can't do much anyway in white's topright group whithout hurting black's corner.
]
;W[og]
;B[jc]
C[Uberdude: Also I think this was bad leaving the h17 weakness and j17 would be better.
]
C[davos: Black's shape would be stronger, but it would also be easier for white M17 to make sabaki by playing K17 himself.
]
;W[db]
C[Uberdude: As now w takes the corner and b has 3 holes in the top side: h17, m17 and r17.
]
;B[eb]
;W[qc]
C[Uberdude: I wanted to play e17 and would be happy if you answered at f18, but was afraid you would tenuki.
]
C[davos: Of course. You ignored K17 so I would probably try to capture M17.
So I think D18 does not prove black K17 wrong. In fact, D18 does not really help white if white does not defend it.
]
C[Uberdude: Well, one think d18 does is prevent black the option of c17 to take the corner if w did end up playing h17 and he wanted to treat f17 lightly. I suppose it also depends on how safe black's and white's groups are after black gets 2 gotes here. If I don't d18 then black gets d18 and then c17, whereas in the game line black got c18 and then b16 later. In the former white can defend at c16 but then black got c17 in sente which is nice. I thought the advantage of this way was that black's shape was weaker so w had more aji to play with. Also I thought w might get sente to play e17, or if as in the game you got there first saving m17 will be good.
]
;B[pc]
;W[rd]
;B[cb]
C[davos: L16 would be safer because it defends black's group at the topright and it defends against w H17.
C18 is too greedy.
]
C[davos: But the important question is: would black be ahead if he plays L16?
I think he would be ahead, but the game would be far from over.

C[davos: Too much greed. N15 would be the most sensible move. I think black would have a good game.
]
C[Uberdude: Yes if black patches that weakness I think black is doing well as you got such a big territory in the lower right and I have been feeling short on points all game. If w b17 then black can spend a move to reinforce and grow it. s9 or p8 or whatever.
]
;W[fd]
;B[gd]
;W[fe]
;B[ge]
C[Uberdude: Given the sequence I found in the game I think this is perhaps a mistake. Defending the cut at g17 or h17 would feel rather overconcentrated so how about playing b15 here? It is big territory and eyes and also has the aji of cutting.
]
C[davos: I think black N15 is even more important.
]
C[Uberdude: True, I didn't realise for quite a while how bad b's aji is there.

C[Uberdude: Maybe defending cut is better?

C[davos: Yes, I think L18 was the game losing blunder.
]
;W[me]
C[Uberdude: This chase was a great success I thought as I got c10 territory in sente.
]
C[davos: Yes, I think black L18 was a big blunder. It was just luck that black was able to save his stones here. But it still cost him a lot.

C[Uberdude: Is k12 better? I liked getting k13 in sente as it meant I didn't have to com back to answer L18.

C[Uberdude: I thought about going for the kill at f7 =) But k4 not having 2 solid eyes was annoying plus I would lose many points on the side in sente. As I found r7 I decided I didn't need to play such a risky way.
]
C[davos: You mean F7 instead of C7?? That would indeed be a high risk strategy.
]
;B[ji]
;W[ij]
;B[oa]
C[davos: A bad move, because white can answer at O17.
]
;W[oe]
C[davos: O17 would be better, I think.
]
C[Uberdude: I thought I read a problem with o17 if you answer at p15 and then I p17 and you q14, though I don't seem able to find it again.

C[Uberdude: I thought it was a mistake to let me get J2 for L2 sente later, but I hadn't seen the ko aji in the corner yet.
]
C[davos: Is it really ko? First I thought black could do something in the corner, but later I thought I had been wrong.
]
C[Uberdude: b4 b5 c2 d2 c1 c5 b2 ko I read.
]
C[davos: Ok, you're right. Then W A6 and white gets to capture first. If black wins the ko he will have spent two gote moves to gain 16 points. That's fairly large endgame.
]
;B[mk]
;W[mj]

;W[fi]
;B[fm]
C[davos: So finally I have to live :)
]
;W[qm]
C[davos: This is another price black has to pay for his mistake at L18. In the process of chasing black, white has gotten moves on the outside which weakened black's area at the bottomright.
]
;B[pm]
C[Uberdude: I think you have lost now that I live in the corner or connect. I think you must s7 to keep the territory. I reduce you a bit but it is not so clear.
]
C[davos: You may be right. 
But if black plays S7, white would Q7. Then black would probably have to play S7 and then white could pla something like P6, B O5, w S9. It feels very submissive for black and it would still be a major turnaround in prospective territory. I think the game is lost for black since he played L18.
]
C[davos: I think with Black S7 black's territory at the bottom would still end up to less than 35 points, and white's territory on the right would end up being about 5 points bigger tan in the game too. So I don't think there is much difference really .
]
C[Uberdude: Yes I think I would win either way as I have already gained a lot from the attack with the left side territory. My point was more that this corner life is simple and there is no chance for me to screw up!

C[Uberdude: This was an interesting yose position. If you don't mind I would like to write an article for British Go Journal about it. L2 looks like sente but it is 6 point gote with 9 point follow up whereas s12 is ~9 points (depends if I t13 or r13) and c5 is 13 points or a ko. With L2 I think I would win the ko though.
]
;W[rh]
;B[kr]
;W[co]
C[Uberdude: Now I lost 3 threats at L2 I was not sure to win the ko so simplified.
]
C[davos: Actually I thought black can't get a ko so B4 was bad. I felt lucky that you defended instead of playing O8 which would be 5 points or so in gote.
]
C[davos: But white wins even with C5, so it doesn't matter much.
]
C[davos: White is right. C5 prevents black from making a ko for 16 points which white gets to capture first. So C5 is worth at least 8 points.

;W[kj]
C[davos: I think K5 is slightly bigger.
]
C[Uberdude: Yes. I realised just after.
]
C[davos: And L16 would be better still, black would answer at K16 and then white could play K5. 
I think white gains a move that way, but perhaps the end result would still be the same.
