C[rsun: thx
]
C[JeansebL: thanks
]
C[JeansebL: Yeah, I wonder if pros play 9x9 a lot :p
]
C[rsun: I heard some do
]
C[JeansebL: I might start training against those bots a bit
]
C[rsun: would 19x19 take too much of your time?
]
C[JeansebL: anyway, I have to go now, so you later :)

C[JeansebL: see ya

C[Ootakamoku: you guys should try again, maybe.. 2.5 point komi would make for an interesting game.
]
C[Ootakamoku: or maybe 3.5 point
]
C[TisButMe: who was playing white ?
]
C[Ootakamoku: CS on a strong computer beats weaker pros.
]
C[Ootakamoku: I play 9x9 against CS (server version), instead of tsumegos
]
C[TisButMe: Which bot is CS ?
]
C[Ootakamoku: crazy stone (was white in this game)
]
C[TisButMe: (thanks)
