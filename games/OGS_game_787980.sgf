C[Levvo: just holy cow.
]
C[Levvo: thanks XD ...
]
C[gamesorry: good game
]
C[Levvo: Good game. =)
]
C[gamesorry: amazing;)
]
C[Levvo: so much blood.
]
C[Levvo: So many mistakes..
]
C[gamesorry: all over the board...
]
C[Levvo: pretty happy with a 1.5 game after my position....
]
C[Levvo: XD
]
C[Levvo: That ko really set things in motion. XD
]
C[gamesorry: I even didn't get enough time to count XD
]
C[Levvo: ye me either.
]
C[gamesorry: yeah how many kos did we have
]
C[gamesorry: haha
]
C[Levvo: 3 major I guess :P
]
C[Levvo: that last move I made.
]
C[Levvo: I think it wasn't needed?
]
C[gamesorry: right:)
]
C[Levvo: I would be so mad if it was a 0.5 game XD
]
C[gamesorry: then it'd be 
]
C[gamesorry: exactly:)
]
C[gamesorry: ok i gotta go, see you guys later:)
]
C[Levvo: see you =)
]
C[Levvo: Xhu, teach me not to overplay? :3
]
C[Levvo: I'd be so dead after this XD..... From move 93: L12 
]
C[Levvo: Yea I guess I will actually get away with it, sort of. From move 93: L12 M13 O13 O14 N14 P14 K13 L14 J14 M10 L11 K16 L17 H16 
]
C[Levvo: yea
]
C[Levvo: XD
]
C[Levvo: This whole game is bad :D
]
C[Levvo: Can't believe I made p6 work.
]
C[Levvo: anyhow
]
C[gamesorry: Can't believe O1 makes the group alive without a ko...
]
C[gamesorry: Why didn't I choose this move.... From move 143: F7 
]
C[gamesorry: Hard for white. From move 198: M19 F17 E18 E17 D16 E16 G18 H18 H19 J19 K18 
]
C[gamesorry: A safer connection?. From move 153: H16 
]
C[Levvo: Ah yes, I did :P
]
C[Levvo: the crazy starts at 168 though
]
C[Levvo: before that it was whites win
]
C[Levvo: No before that its just me overplaying and losing the game :P
]
C[Levvo: Oh? :P
]
C[Levvo: I died in the corner though? :P
]
C[Levvo: yea
]
C[Levvo: myea
]
C[Levvo: I did some really sad playing in that top right corner.. XD
]
C[Levvo: you mean the ko?
]
C[Levvo: Right
]
C[Levvo: But kill white?
]
C[Levvo: Because..
]
C[Levvo: I was beeing stupid =)
]
C[Levvo: Just this is enough I think. Black has no eyes.. From move 224: T15 S19 
]
C[Levvo: Losing move.. From move 37: 
]
C[Levvo: considering what white gained on that exchange?
]
C[Levvo: Yepp, losing move :P
]
C[Levvo: From beeing not settled. To beeing super strong with huuuge influence.
]
C[Levvo: yes
]
C[Levvo: Three are a ton of bigger moves.. From move 36: 
]
C[Levvo: Hahaha
]
C[Levvo: Yes, that's true too I guess.
]
C[Levvo: The time didn't help.
]
C[Levvo: yea
]
C[Levvo: G'night herb
]
C[Levvo: I see The Arctic has snuck aboard? :D
]
C[Levvo: This move was the filling my own space.. From move 321: 
]
C[Levvo: It's too close to whites huuuuuge wall
]
C[Levvo: And if its something you should learn to do, it is to respect.. the wall.
]
C[Levvo: Hehehe
]
C[Levvo: Yes Linux but.
]
C[Levvo: Just somethhing silly like this and where is the moyo?. From move 36: F8 D8 F6 D6 B4 B5 B3 C5 A5 A6 A4 C7 
]
C[Levvo: Right
]
C[Levvo: Its impossible to say what would happen XD
]
C[Levvo: Later.
]
C[Levvo: So better just let it be.
]
C[Levvo: Take big points.
]
C[Levvo: yea
]
C[Levvo: for example
]
C[Levvo: Ex.. From move 37: E8 B10 R12 
]
C[Levvo: Even if black just lives there. And white gets the top.
]
C[Levvo: He fixes his weakness and gets something like a potential 15+p on the side.
]
C[Levvo: Compared to black just getting 6 points straight up.
]
C[Levvo: Right, black is undercut on both sides.
]
C[Levvo: This is quite horirble for black tbh. But this is probably better then what happend in the game.
]
C[Levvo: In the game I gave white soo much
]
C[Levvo: Then ignored everything and took r9.
]
C[Levvo: White got all that for blacks C12 pretty much. And I got sente to play R9 which was probably my ownly salvation.. From move 53: 
]
C[Levvo: No lead is lead in points :P
]
C[Levvo: Ahead in the game.
]
C[Levvo: More likely to win? =)
]
C[Levvo: Sente early means you get the biggest point on the board.
]
C[Levvo: So it's importaint ofcourse.
]
C[Levvo: Depends on the situation :P
]
C[Levvo: And how obvious it is.
]
C[Levvo: Its almost impossible to "read out" a fuseki.
]
C[Levvo: You can know a few by heart, but that doesn't mean your opponent will play like that.
]
C[Levvo: Is this some kind of traumatic event you experienced xhu? :P
]
C[Levvo: Haha I see.
]
C[Levvo: You're nr 1 in 19x19?
]
C[Levvo: ^^
]
C[Levvo: Maybe it's time for me to take my lessons back up with mr. Jeff.
]
C[Levvo: To bad I wont have time starting next month =/
]
C[Levvo: Su Yang.
]
C[Levvo: A good friend to Antti (Ten)
]
C[Levvo: And my teacher :P
]
C[Levvo: Yea, 6 dan EGF from China originally.
]
C[Levvo: :D
]
C[Levvo: I don't think he is.
]
C[Levvo: They're working on teaching tools now =)
]
C[Levvo: Yes ^_^ 
]
C[Levvo: I think I'm going to start my online go club up soon again.
]
C[Levvo: Just need super active people to join in ;)
]
C[Levvo: Like.. driven people.
]
C[Levvo: Yes.
]
C[Levvo: Had some nice ideas with it too.
]
C[Levvo: Around the globe.
]
C[Levvo: Along with sweden.
]
C[Levvo: Yea I thought they were doing that.
]
C[Levvo: Let's go back to the normal chat XD ...
]
C[Levvo: Alright :P
]
C[Levvo: G'night then! =)
]
C[xhu98: WOW
]
C[xhu98: 323 moves. 1.5 points
]
C[xhu98: What a game
]
C[xhu98: You guys were literally fighting everywhere on the board
]
C[xhu98: Hey yo
]
C[xhu98: Yeah kind of
]
C[xhu98: It's still complicated though because the groups are so split
]
C[xhu98: But I guess White would go for the top right corner
]
C[xhu98: Would be bad if he succeeded
]
C[LinuxGooo: oh.. a chinese 
]
C[LinuxGooo: till move 60 white dominated the centre, hm ?
]
C[xhu98: yep
]
C[xhu98: And yes he's Chinese
]
C[xhu98: Levvo saw us reviewing our game in Mandarin
]
C[xhu98: That game was less intense than this one
]
C[herbie: normal up to move 5 huh? xD
]
C[xhu98: I'd say White is good at the start
]
C[LinuxGooo: lots of josekis in the beginning, hm
]
C[xhu98: yeah
]
C[LinuxGooo: for me its alrady crazyat move 80-85 haha
]
C[xhu98: At that point I already thought it'd be an overturn
]
C[xhu98: For Black
]
C[xhu98: Yeah
]
C[xhu98: Top right?
]
C[xhu98: That has a lot of aji
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm... I think you provoked it playing "on the edge"
]
C[xhu98: White needs at least one extra move
]
C[xhu98: Yeah then P18 will be sente
]
C[xhu98: I think Black left White live in the top left corner
]
C[xhu98: That was a pity
]
C[xhu98: before the third ko
]
C[xhu98: The third ko started because of that aji in the top right corner
]
C[LinuxGooo: why did black play first S19 instead of T16 ?
]
C[LinuxGooo: move 225
]
C[xhu98: Black would have been dead anyways
]
C[LinuxGooo: ah, I see R17 is the vital point, hm ?
]
C[LinuxGooo: vital point R17 ?. From move 224: T15 T14 T16 Q19 P18 P19 R19 R17 
]
C[xhu98: Or White can just reduce from outside
]
C[xhu98: Black doesn't have sufficient space
]
C[xhu98: But then again, White's outside doesn't technically have two eyes either
]
C[herbie: false eyes are confusing D=
]
C[xhu98: yes they are
]
C[herbie: the not-so-obvious ones xD
]
C[xhu98: Especially when you have interlocking groups
]
C[xhu98: Well, maybe not the losing move
]
C[xhu98: Oh wow
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm.. C8 I think would have been of benefit if black expanded it with C6 to a base
]
C[xhu98: Yeah R9 was more urgent
]
C[xhu98: I don't blame either side for the midgame though
]
C[xhu98: It's just too much for a live quick game
]
C[xhu98: I like D in that case
]
C[herbie: blech ok this is getting too much for past 2 am >.>;
]
C[herbie: Night guys!
]
C[xhu98: o/
]
C[LinuxGooo: good night, Herbie
]
C[xhu98: Good night
]
C[LinuxGooo: Herbie, did you become member of our Rengo Group?
]
C[LinuxGooo: yeah, I pulled him in... :-)
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm.... this "big move" thing sometimes I still do not understand.....
]
C[xhu98: Otherwise it'd be a half-pointer
]
C[LinuxGooo: for one of these 4 big moves you would let die C6 ?
]
C[xhu98: Yeah
]
C[xhu98: Because it's sandwiched
]
C[xhu98: And weak
]
C[xhu98: So just leave the aji there
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm... yes, C6 is weak, but with H5 and D10 white could create a big mojo left side, isnt ?
]
C[xhu98: Levvo: in gamesorry's case
]
C[xhu98: This is the great wall of China
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm... yes, I know the risks of walls 
]
C[LinuxGooo: play away from thickness
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm... I see
]
C[LinuxGooo: so C6 would have made white more strong
]
C[LinuxGooo: if playing there further on
]
C[xhu98: Well, some aji too
]
C[xhu98: This is early on in the game
]
C[xhu98: So you don't want to pull out a weak group now
]
C[xhu98: R9 is on spot though
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm... got it
]
C[xhu98: Yeah
]
C[xhu98: Plus Black's top right corner is not good
]
C[xhu98: If White gets too close
]
C[xhu98: White wrestled too much though
]
C[xhu98: The idea is if you get a lead and you can secure it, just do so
]
C[LinuxGooo: is "lead" = sente ?
]
C[xhu98: not exactly
]
C[xhu98: Well if you are sente,
]
C[xhu98: You are likely to establish a lead
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm... ok
]
C[xhu98: Yeah
]
C[xhu98: Then you can just profit from sente exchanges
]
C[xhu98: And keep pushing to winning
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm
]
C[LinuxGooo: how many moves you guys can pre-read ?
]
C[xhu98: Hard to say
]
C[xhu98: I like close battles more
]
C[xhu98: Because sometimes is just a tsumego problem really
]
C[xhu98: *it's
]
C[LinuxGooo: in such an early stage like move 37 I can pre-read max. 2-3 moves... not more
]
C[xhu98: Opening is vague
]
C[xhu98: But it should be more and more concrete as you proceed
]
C[xhu98: For example, what if you meet herminator
]
C[xhu98: And he starts a battle from a komoku pincer joseki
]
C[xhu98: This is what I am experiencing right NOW
]
C[xhu98: xD
]
C[xhu98: In my effort to defend #1 on the ladder
]
C[LinuxGooo: :-)
]
C[xhu98: Temporarily
]
C[xhu98: Fame for a few days
]
C[xhu98: Why not, you know :-)
]
C[LinuxGooo: it seems this "ladder thing" is attracing many Go players :-)
]
C[LinuxGooo: who is Mr. Jeff ?
]
C[xhu98: Oh wow
]
C[LinuxGooo: your teacher ?
]
C[LinuxGooo: ah... nice.
]
C[xhu98: pretty cool
]
C[xhu98: lol Herman is my teacher then
]
C[xhu98: My plan is
]
C[xhu98: To assemble a crew of teachers
]
C[LinuxGooo: is Jeff in Japane too like Ten ?
]
C[LinuxGooo: hm... OGS urgently needs teachers, indeed....
]
C[LinuxGooo: but so long the "teaching tool" (audio) is not working, I have my doubts that high dans can be attracted... this endless typing in the game chat isn very suitable for
]
C[LinuxGooo: isnt*
]
C[xhu98: Yeah they are suggesting that
]
C[LinuxGooo: its not on highest priority for the developers I heard
]
C[xhu98: That's just my plan for the GO Basics crew though
]
C[LinuxGooo: really ?
]
C[xhu98: Yeah
]
C[xhu98: probably bug fixes first, then
]
C[LinuxGooo: yes, I see it as the most urgent work
]
C[xhu98: I am trying to recruit more and more people
]
C[LinuxGooo: even more important than re-designing the tournament system
]
C[xhu98: nice!
]
C[LinuxGooo: you had an online Go club ?
]
C[LinuxGooo: people from Sweden ? Or around the globe ?
]
C[LinuxGooo: Mikasa wanted bring the ASR from KGS to OGS
]
C[LinuxGooo: she already got the OK from the owner 
]
C[LinuxGooo: so she told couple of weeks ago
]
C[LinuxGooo: :-)
]
C[LinuxGooo: ok.... its late here
]
C[LinuxGooo: I will say Good night 
]
C[xhu98: Alrighty
]
C[LinuxGooo: I keep it in mind to bring you all together for a Rengo game, promised, OK !
]
C[LinuxGooo: ;-)
]
C[LinuxGooo: see you
]
C[LinuxGooo: bye
