C[Uberdude: Maybe I p9? but then you s11. Perhaps q6 too slow.

C[Uberdude: Intersting, don't often see 2-space cap. Why not 1-space?
]
C[morituri: I thought you would slip out easily by attaching (to a one space cap).

C[Uberdude: k2 stronger response?

C[Uberdude: I was happy to live in a way which means I had some aji on m4 group.

C[Uberdude: You showed this was rather thin, maybe I should c9 or e11?
]
C[morituri: C8 seems natural at first, maybe there's a variation for white later? E11 looks very solid - are you that far ahead?

C[Uberdude: I was tempted to play e9 but was afraid you would tenuki to c18. I felt I won the game in yose and c18 was the start of that.
]
;B[pf]
C[Uberdude: and p14 was the other move I considered which you destroyed in sente.
]
C[morituri: Regarding yose, I counted you ahead all the time... although this Q14 feels very satisfactory :)
