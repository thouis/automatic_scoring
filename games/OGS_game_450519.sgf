C[integer: why all this forcing :(
]
C[integer: manhandled
]
C[paintcan: you gotta pay for all the excellent big points you got
]
;W[mc]
C[paintcan: i sent the game you won by 10.5 for review
]
C[paintcan: cant wait to find out how i lost in the first 10 moves
]
C[paintcan: you make a difficult fuseki integer
]
C[integer: i have this very stubborn conviction that "proper fuseki" matters very little at our level. i might be wrong, but like i said, stubborn. i feel it's more about psychological comfort, a sort of wet blanket if you will. of course also what kind of style one has etc
]
C[integer: i always tell beginners, like 10-30 kyus who for whatever reason get it into their head to study fuseki patterns and memorize joseki
]
C[integer: to cut that shit out
]
C[integer: because it doesn't matter. no matter how good your fuseki is, a game is long and hard, and if you don't have the middle game sense or tactics or l&d or endgame etc to back it up it matters for shit, and anyone who instead spent the same amount of hours simply grinding problems is just gonna steamroll you into a humiliating defeat
]
C[integer: and i feel principle still counts for something even at 1d-ish level
]
C[integer: tactics/shape intuition + endgame i think are the single two most important things in the game, where you can have absolutely atrocious fuseki and know basically nothing about joseki and still play well
]
C[integer: i feel my tactics are kind of up to snuff, but my endgame as i've said i am unhappy with so i think that will be my next focus
]
C[integer: just need to get some good endgame problem sets or something
]
;B[ob]
C[integer: but full disclosure i was also one of those 10 kyus who loved to study opening theory. because it is fun and beautiful and pure intellectual masturbation, thinking about strategy in such a way, like some big war general
]
C[integer: but also had major online go anxiety and shit, analysis paralysis, etc. and then i took salvia, found fake enlightenment, switched to blitz, rediscovered the chaotic good, and haven't looked back since
]
C[paintcan: i took some drugs
]
C[paintcan: and studied joseki and the opening
]
C[paintcan: and broke the 1d barrier
]
C[paintcan: im absolutely convinced that fuseki is critical
]
C[paintcan: along with attack & defense
]
;W[fl]
C[paintcan: games are won and lost all the time because of insufficient tactics, life & death, shape, however you like
]
C[paintcan: but fine shapes can lose games by 30 points easily
]
C[paintcan: that was always a problem for me
]
C[paintcan: theres no grandiose delusions of strategy
]
C[paintcan: there's simply a matter of having sufficient strategy
]
C[paintcan: and insufficient strategy
]
C[paintcan: any single element of the game can fuck you up, but the thing i hate most
]
C[paintcan: is fighting an inferior early midgame
]
C[paintcan: due to strategic mistakes in the opening
]
C[paintcan: i prefer having a superior midgame that falls apart due to tactical mistakes
]
C[paintcan: to anything else
]
C[paintcan: winning a lost game? its ok, but its not as good as losing a won game
]
C[paintcan: i was not a 10 kyu who studied opening endlessly and masturbated
]
C[paintcan: i was a shitty player who read a few problem books on invading and gthen
]
C[paintcan: after studying direction of play, attack & defnse and the 3 volumes of ishida
]
C[paintcan: i rose from 8 kyu to 1d in about a year or so, with regular club play and problems
]
C[paintcan: now i study the opening endlessly and masturbate, but not really
]
C[paintcan: that game i sent in for review was definitely lost in fuseki
]
C[paintcan: / early middle game
]
C[paintcan: could i win if i was a few stones stronger solely on the basis of reading? sure, if i probed the shit out of you and exploited every mistake you made
]
C[paintcan: but someone stronger wouldn't have gone into middle game with such a poor fight
]
C[integer: not sure if opposite viewpoint or what then
]
C[integer: mid-game is very important, yeah, or particularly the ability to determine what is weak and what is strong, and what direction to attack in
]
C[integer: but as for fuseki itself, like just the corners, extensions, as well as "joseki" choices, i think that has very little correlation for how the game will turn out for me
]
C[integer: and i can't even evaluate whether i'm behind or ahead, so it's useless for me to talk about "losing a won game" or "winning a lost game" when it comes even to the midgame
]
C[integer: like this game, like any of the last games, unless i make some sort of tactical blunder, i have no idea
]
C[integer: is this game good for white, is it good for black, i think it just depends on who you ask and how emotionally invested they are. some people will always feel they are faring poorly (like me)
]
C[integer: but i did the opposite
]
C[integer: i went from around 8 kyu to 1 dan only doing problems
]
C[integer: not playing any serious games really
]
C[integer: no theory
]
C[integer: just grinding fairly easy problems, getting shape instinct
]
C[integer: and blitz. and it was very liberating because i got more of a matrix like intuition about where "something could happen". like i wouldn't even read, just like, ok i play there, he answers, and then i "feel" i can do something
]
;B[mk]
C[integer: and merry christmas
]
C[integer: want to get drunk but then the terrorists will win
]
C[integer: instead gonna do a party dose of ritalin
]
C[integer: got woken up half through sleep being asked if i wanted to go eat porridge at the house of my now-alchoholic grandfather who molested my mother and sister. "no, i don't want to do that, i want to sleep"
]
C[integer: sleep forever
]
C[paintcan: thats sine mesed up stuff man
]
C[paintcan: mery christmas
]
C[paintcan: heh, well
]
C[paintcan: id crush blitzers for that reason when i was coming up
]
C[paintcan: feeling the shape possibilities
]
;W[me]
C[paintcan: but slower games were always another matter
]
C[paintcan: anyways, the pleasure is to play
]
C[paintcan: it makes no difference what you say

C[integer: did the chat history just disappear here?
]
C[integer: oh there it is

C[integer: had a very strange thing happen to me on the train
]
C[integer: coming back from my father's
]
C[integer: some crazy middle eastern looking guy went around acting all crazy middle eastern and didn't speak english or norwegian but he was trying to talk to everyone and since it's norway of course everyone is like wtf get away from me you crazy person because people here don't talk to strangers here unless they are crazy or super drunk, culturally
]
C[integer: but i heard him speak some french words and i was excited i could recognize and understand some of it since i've been doing some french studying lately
]
C[integer: so i tried talking to him
]
C[integer: and through this pretty thick language barrier with lots of gesticulations and pointing at pictures on my tablet since i can't actually speak french for shit i got some story
]
C[integer: about him being like this rabbi from monte carlo and he was assaulted and beat up by anti-semites somewhere and they took his wallet, phone, credit cards, etc, everything he had on him. also knocked out two of his teeth
]
C[integer: and the police had just put him on this train and he was trying to get to the synagogue in oslo for communication/community/help (j'espère, j'espère)
]
C[integer: like with no money etc
]
C[integer: but he also seemed pretty uhh off, maybe just confused/in shock/insane or maybe was some con man beggar or what
]
C[integer: but i said i'd take him there and got a taxi to drive him there and gave him some money and my phone number and later also talked to some people at the jewish community center
]
C[integer: where they didn't really know what to do with him either because even though they had a french speaker he still wasn't making that much sense and there were some weird holes in his story
]
C[paintcan: was he crazy
]
;W[gk]
C[integer: no idea
]
C[integer: that was like, saturday, and since then i've gotten 4 phone calls while i was sleeping (during the day) from like really confused and petrified random norwegian people
]
C[integer: who were just like "uh i'm with some guy... he says.. he knows you? and wants you to meet him at central station etc"
]
C[integer: and i was half asleep the two times the phone actually woke me up
]
C[integer: and i could hear him shouting excited in the background all "frank frank!" and babbling in french
]
C[paintcan: haha
]
C[paintcan: oh man
]
C[integer: but both times i was like too out of it to go, and just said i couldn't (don't have a car, would have taken me half an hour on the bus just to get downtown and i can't function on less than 8 hrs sleep)
]
C[integer: feeling kind of bad about that because he was so fucking grateful for me helping him in the first place
]
C[integer: and kept promising to call me and reward me or whatever (or just con me further if he was a con beggar person i don't really know)
]
C[paintcan: poor guy
]
C[integer: on the train he was all like kissing his kippah or whatever he had and saying something that sounded like hebrew
]
C[integer: with all the chchchhrhcrhch sounds
]
;B[fm]
;W[ki]
;B[hh]
;W[fk]
C[integer: though someone from the jewish community center was gonna contact me later because if he really was attacked, and attacked in norway, that was like a huge deal to them
]
C[integer: and needed to get to ze bottom of itt
]
;B[el]
C[integer: the thing was though he was wearing really nice clothes and had like two big suitcases that looked really high end and they all had like emirates airline tags
]
C[paintcan: oh might be the real deal
]
;W[kh]
C[integer: yeah or stolen, who knows. but he was just really weird, couldn't possibly imagine him as some business man person
]
C[integer: he said he was travelling for business though, worked with jewelry
]
C[paintcan: maybe the crazy or half witted scion of a wealthy family
]
C[integer: gave me a phone number in monte carlo (right country code but too many digits), an address (that was real but seemed like it was just random in front of nothing), as well as an email (domain didn't exist)
]
C[paintcan: and that sounds like a con
]
C[paintcan: heh
]
C[integer: yeah
]
C[integer: i don't really mind the taxi or money i gave him though, was an adventure
]
C[paintcan: for sure
]
;B[ei]
C[integer: i also feel slightly bad for him if con person because norway isn't the country he should be in then
]
C[integer: even though we're rich trying to get strangers to even talk to you is gonna be hard
]
C[integer: but if he calls again i definitely want to meet him
]
C[integer: even have some english-french bilingual book he can have to work on his game~
]
C[integer: everybody speaks english hardly any speak french
]
;W[fi]
;B[fh]
;W[eh]
;B[fg]
C[paintcan: you just reminded me
]
C[paintcan: of a korean contortionist i saw performing in a public square in reykjavik this summer
]
C[paintcan: he got a fair sized crowd but it looked like slim pickings after his show
]
;W[df]
C[integer: the money?
]
C[paintcan: a bunch of skateboard punk children tossed coins at him
]
C[paintcan: well, in his general direction
]
C[paintcan: very nice
]
;B[ik]
;W[ij]
C[integer: there's almost this.. embarrassment with giving money to panhandlers or street performers in norway too
]
;B[jj]
C[paintcan: looks like i lose
]
C[integer: you get c15 and uhh can you J13 and cut?
]
;W[jk]
;B[jl]
;W[kk]
C[paintcan: no, it's game over after this
]
C[paintcan: f11 was too much
]
;B[jm]
C[integer: i think my H7 was too much
]
C[integer: but just had no idea
]
C[paintcan: one impatient move counteracts another
]
C[integer: maybe as white i'd play G9 instead of attach, and i'd still would be clueless
]
C[paintcan: i think the basic result is ok
]
C[paintcan: if id been less hard line about preventing your group from escaping
]
C[paintcan: i'd have R12 to play now
]
C[integer: S15 probe surely
]
;W[hj]
C[paintcan: i don't think there's any need for a probe
]
C[integer: hehe maybe
]
C[integer: but those are the kinds of move i always play when i want to pretend i know what i'm doing
]
C[integer: trick of confidence
]
C[integer: hmmm
]
;B[ji]
;W[in]
;B[ll]
;W[lk]
C[integer: that move wasn't in my blitz instinct brain patterns
]
C[paintcan: when all is lost
]
C[paintcan: it comes down to unnatural moves
]
C[integer: now you don't seem to lose at all tho
]
C[integer: do not see a counter
]
C[paintcan: im sure theres a way
]
C[integer: fuu
]

;B[go]

;W[io]
C[paintcan: this is one way
]
C[paintcan: to kesh an aji
]
C[paintcan: of course your central grou pis alive no matter what
]
C[paintcan: because of the shortage on h10
]
C[paintcan: and the strained aji of l1
]
C[paintcan: l10
]
C[paintcan: so this is hardly a coup for white
]
;B[ce]
;W[ml]
;B[gd]
;W[gc]
;B[fe]
;W[fa]
C[paintcan: for a moment
]
C[paintcan: i thought you'd play E19
]
;B[ed]
;W[gb]
C[integer: oh didn't even look i'm just a really big fan of forcing
]
C[paintcan: i think it may have worked
]
;B[gp]
;W[bq]
C[integer: no idea now
]
C[paintcan: this will be an embarrassing game to send to younggil
]
C[integer: hahah
]
;B[ph]
C[paintcan: oh
]
C[paintcan: i did get a review back
]
C[paintcan: for that other one
]
C[paintcan: are you interested
]
C[integer: sure but if you keep sending them i have to send you something
]
C[paintcan: you're sending me something - a bunch of moves
]
C[paintcan: there's no review with no game
]
C[integer: something a bit more than that. if you give me your address i can order you fisher's caramel roasted popcorn
]
C[integer: that shit is like pure crack
]
C[integer: sweat to god
]
C[integer: r*
]
C[integer: i had one taste and i ate nothing else for like 3 days when i was in the us
]
C[integer: cause they come in these huge containers too
]
C[integer: can get ones the size of trash cans

C[integer: what sgf viewer do you use on linux
]
C[paintcan: cgoban3, honestly
]
C[integer: do you know of any that's good without java
]
C[paintcan: qgo?
]
C[paintcan: there was a good one i had before, but i forget  now
]
C[integer: cause java can't handle tiling window managers that well
]
C[integer: at least not my version
]
C[paintcan: i do think it was qgo
]
C[paintcan: ah
]
C[paintcan: i've got xmonad running
]
C[integer: i liked drago for windows, maybe i can try it in wine
]
C[integer: yeah me too
]
C[paintcan: there's a way to get java to work with it
]
C[paintcan: export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1
]
C[paintcan: ive got this in my .bashrc
]
C[paintcan: and the other thing was
]
C[integer: yeah the env shit? but i always forget what it is and have to google it every time and it's driving me nuts
]
C[integer: yeah that's the one
]
C[integer: oh right, .profile is a good idea
]
C[integer: i start a java program like twice a year
]
C[integer: so never get around
]
C[paintcan: well i think
]
;B[li]
C[paintcan: xmonad 0.11
]
C[paintcan: solved the other one
]
C[integer: hmm
]
C[paintcan: i had to find a patch for xmonad 0.10
]
C[paintcan: and add some stuff to my config, just a little
]
C[integer: installed qgo here but i don't see a way to get a game tree
]
C[paintcan: but i got rid of that junk with 0.11
]
C[integer: "game tree tools" buttons do nothing
]
C[paintcan: i havent used it in a while
]
C[paintcan: have you tried
]
C[paintcan: panda-glGo?
]
;W[lh]
;B[rf]
;W[cg]
C[paintcan: man, it is uncanny talking to you
]
C[paintcan: another go playing video hacking nerd who also uses xmonad

C[integer: there must be dozens of us. dozens!
]
;B[bg]
;W[re]
;B[kl]

;B[rf]
C[paintcan: i forget
]
C[paintcan: are you a vim or an emacs
]
C[integer: "this attachment is not a joseki" ._.
]
C[integer: emacs
]
C[paintcan: because xmonad and emacs is the best operating system ever
]
C[paintcan: emacs-client & emacs daemon
]
C[paintcan: do you use mu4e too?
]
C[paintcan: because if you did, that would be one sick world we live in
]
C[integer: haven't even heard of it
]
C[integer: what is it
]
C[paintcan: ahh
]
C[paintcan: it's an email reader
]
C[integer: ah
]
C[paintcan: well email client
]
C[paintcan: it is pretty good
]
C[paintcan: younggil doesn't find much to complain about in your later play
]
C[integer: no i'm a patriot and i love nsa so i only use gmail really
]
C[paintcan: i use gmail too, but i do my work gmail through mu4e
]
C[paintcan: god bless america etc.
]
C[integer: my mail both work and private is just a mess. like Inbox (1938) type of thing
]
C[paintcan: me too
]
C[paintcan: i took pleasure watching that tick past 1337
]
C[paintcan: a few years ago
]
C[integer: if anything disappears from the first page i'm never replying to that mail
]
C[paintcan: Inbox (3477) right now
]
C[integer: nice
]
C[paintcan: but i made another hosted email account
]
C[integer: i did an 'archive all' a while back
]
C[paintcan: im not using it regularly yet

C[paintcan: but when i switch over, im not letting junkmail shit all over me again
]
C[integer: holy fuck, 49871 emails total
]
;W[ig]
;B[jg]
C[paintcan: only 10,000 here
]
;W[re]
C[paintcan: that is some next level pile of trash
]
C[integer: i subscribed to a bunch of "a word a day" things years ago
]
C[integer: plus i get a surprising amount of like.. email sent to the wrong person
]
C[paintcan: you have a good email address for that
]
C[integer: gotten car insurance stuff, get weekly summaries for some "mom's club", gotten hotel bookings, loads of dick pictures and angry drama dating rants (cause i think someone used my juicy.tits@gmail.com on some adult hookup shit maybe), weird jokes sent from some grandma on a phone, mails in croatsian about running or something, nsa membership email, video rental return slips
]
C[integer: i have a couple of gmails that forward to the main ones, don't really use them
]
C[integer: but just get this weird shit
