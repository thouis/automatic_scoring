C[Mikasa: Thanks
]
C[jianq: thanks
]
C[Mikasa: Darn so close
]
C[jianq: well, you needed to count
]
C[Mikasa: Count?
]
C[jianq: I was up a lot of points thats why I played n5
]
C[jianq: I mean I new I was up like 10 points
]
C[Mikasa: Mine JeansebL
]
C[Mikasa: ?
]
C[jianq: ?
]
C[Mikasa: I agree it was weird
]
C[Mikasa: I couldn't even muster up how to respond to that
]
C[jianq: peace 
]
C[Mikasa: How would counting have helped me Jianq?
]
C[Mikasa: I mean earlier on yeah.... but how so at the ending?
]
C[jianq: no when you say it was close, you seem to be surprised
]
C[Mikasa: Of course I didn't count the score
]
C[Mikasa: The computer did it for me
]
C[jianq: which you should not, because you needed to count before to judge the way you play
]
C[Mikasa: How so?
]
C[Mikasa: I felt I played great
]
C[Mikasa: And I didn't have to count to do that
]
C[jianq: well, it does not take too much time
]
C[jianq: like 2 minutes
]
C[Mikasa: But, it was the ending and I knew the bigger moes that needed to be played
]
C[Mikasa: I also knew I was behind earlier in the game
]
C[Mikasa: So I didn't see a point in counting now
]
C[Mikasa: All the big moves are gone so I left the rest of the counting up to the machine
]
C[Mikasa: If earlier I came to a point where I had to be risky than I defenitly would have counted
]
C[jianq: well, i meant before the big ones were gone
]
C[Mikasa: I did count before the big ones were gone :)
]
C[jianq: here we go, now we seem to understand what I was saying, I felt that you havent pushed hard enough when it was still chaos
]
C[jianq: I am a bad fighter as a 4d
]
C[Mikasa: There wasn't much left I could do
]
C[Mikasa: So I just played the biggest possible moves
]
C[Mikasa: See you in lobby
]
C[DeathTheKid101: nvm. stupid mistake
]
C[Forensicator: I thought it was dead at first too :p
]
C[Forensicator: Gratz jianq

]

]
C[JeansebL: no ''Well you needed to count''
]
