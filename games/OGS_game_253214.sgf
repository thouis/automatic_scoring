C[Uberdude: Black can defend at b6 or e7 directly, the idea of this move is to get some useful exchanges on the outside and induce defending.
]
;W[ep]
C[Uberdude: The most solid answer, more common is to come out at g4 (both these moves are defending against black's attack at e2).
]
;B[em]
C[Uberdude: h3 is quite light now, it would be heavier if g4 h4 g5 had happened.
]
;W[ce]
C[Uberdude: Biggest point, if black got to approach here it would work well with d9 strength.
]
C[Uberdude: @topazg, sure c6 stones have aji, black has no territory there, just thickness. Awakening those stones will hurt the corner though.
]
;B[kd]
C[Uberdude: An unusual pincer, I decided to expirement. @Celebrir, the reason I didn't m16 is then p14 r13 k16 then white's upper left is one line bigger, but that's not to say it is bad. L17 is probably most common idea in this shape, but I decided to play high to work with e7 thickness.
]
;W[of]
;B[qg]
;W[id]
;B[kf]
;W[oh]
C[Uberdude: In this sort of shape white will often press at q12 (to stop black coming up to the 4th line), to which black pushes and cuts and there is a fight. e7 thickness should help in fighting, so white choses the simple option.
]
;B[pi]
;W[qc]
C[Uberdude: White should probably cap at l12 now, attack that group is white's compensation for the locally slack p12 q11 exchange.
]
C[Uberdude: This move gives black a chance to cut at p16 (white q16 or q15 is played to ensure that connection in sente), but I was unsure how much profit I'd get in the centre and I have to give white a big corner e.g. p16 q16 q15 q17 p15 r15 r14 s16. But maybe that is better than my s17 as it makes L16 strong and I do have a decent centre potential.

;W[oi]
C[Uberdude: I was surprised white pushed on the 4th line to give me all that territory, but the p11 wall does make it hard for me to develop the centre and w can get the s3 yose in sente which is big. Hard to judge.

C[Uberdude: Mistake, should s5 for 2 fewer ko threats. My thinking was white might invade r8 area or cut at q9 and going one line further will help me kill it, but s5 should kill any nonsense just fine.
]
C[Uberdude: This almost ended up being the losing move!

C[Uberdude: I expected g16, it seems a strong shape.

;B[ie]
;W[hc]
;B[go]
C[Uberdude: I also considered f12 here, as it might mean I can kill c11 invasion. White can then come in at g5, but maybe that's better as k3 area is rather small anyway with the m2 and h2 yose.
]
;W[ci]
C[Uberdude: Although white gave black a big territory on the right side, that's black's only territory so far and white has a lot of corners.

C[Uberdude: I was actually a bit afraid of white h13 here, the k16 group only has 1 eye and could get cut.
]

C[Uberdude: the p10 p9 stones come in very handy for white here.
]
;B[jl]
;W[ki]
;B[lk]
;W[fg]
;B[fh]
;W[ei]
C[Uberdude: This push stops any chance black has of making a gote eye here, but it's probably bad as e12 can help me jump in e15 area (and loses a ko threat).
]
;B[eh]
;W[kh]
C[Uberdude: Now white is counter attacking and threatening black's top group.
]
;B[jh]
C[Uberdude: This defends k13 peep which destroys eye shape, and threatens j10 cut.

C[Uberdude: White gets sente for this big point at the top, but perhaps n18 is better as that helps p17 more which has fewer eyes than k17.

C[Uberdude: It's very big, but so is o18/p18. And o18 is white's sente. Although I can run in at e15 and destroy some white area, I can't make any eyes there.
]
;B[ob]
;W[pb]
;B[mb]
;W[sb]
C[Uberdude: Instinct says white should atari at p19 first, as if black connects it's a good exchange, and if ko then white might not need to defend at t18: "kikashi before defending". t18 is a big yose move too though.

;W[hr]
C[Uberdude: p19 first, if I answer a good exchange for white, but maybe I tenuki to h2, not sure which bigger. I didn't realise quite how big h2 was as it makes me need to defend inside a few times and lots of ko threats.

C[Uberdude: Mistake, should L13 1 point double sente first.
]
C[Uberdude: I had resigned myself to the g8 blunder losing me this game, but now I had some hope: if I play perfectly and white makes another little mistake or two maybe I can claw back the victory.
]
;B[kg]
C[Uberdude: Thanks to the p18 n18 l17 combo black is thick here so white can't extend at m15, black cuts and easily wins the semeai. This is a good example of how thickness helps in yose. If white had played n18 he probably could have bullied my j14 dragon into making only 2 eyes whilst getting all the yose.
]
;W[lh]
;B[le]
;W[fl]
C[Uberdude: To add insult to injury, g8 is now a liability and saving it gives me bad shape with the j3 weakness, I may have to lose points defending inside my territory.

C[Uberdude: 2 points in sente, black will have to defend at s13 once q15 liberty filled.

;W[de]
;B[hf]
;W[ge]
;B[fo]
C[Uberdude: It's annoying to play a move like this that makes no points and just connects (g13 is 3 points), but if white plays here I need to play a defensive move inside my territory on both sides at k4 and c7 (even if I get a4, once all the liberties are gone white c7 would kill d5 stones. White playing here would also make e3 a point and makes the opportunity to make a further point at f4.
]
C[Uberdude: This game is now a half pointer which will be decided by the k8 ko. If white plays perfectly I think he has more threats so I lose, so I need to play in the way which makes white's best move harder to find.
]
;W[gq]
;B[hp]
;W[gg]
C[Uberdude: This is obviously 3 points (if black gets it he makes h13 and j13, and e13 is his privilege to take away f14, and this way h13 is white's privilege), and a5 looks like only 2 points, but in fact a5 is also 3 points as once all the dame liberties are gone white could have b6 atari, then k4 atari, I connect at j5 and m4 capture. So despite getting f5 I still need to defend inside! Also a5 would give white a lot of ko threats with the b6 etc ataris. So this is another little mistake from white, not because it is fewer points than a5, but because it is the same points but fewer ko threats!
]
;B[gk]
;W[hk]
;B[jl]
;W[kk]
C[Uberdude: Instead of connecting, white should play ko threats. It can't be worse than connecting (if white wins the ko l9 is wasted move) and could be better, but I think it actually ends up the same as the game anyway as capturing here is 4 points so white can't play a 1 point yose move miai as a ko threat.
]
;B[ap]
;W[aq]
;B[ao]
;W[ja]
C[Uberdude: Because it's japanese rules the ko is only 1 point so this is correct (if white connects black plays the 1 point reverse sente here), but if it were chinese rules the ko is more than 1 point so it could be best to leave these moves for ko threats.
]
;B[la]
;W[ag]
;B[ai]
;W[hg]
;B[ig]
;W[ii]
C[Uberdude: This one and f4 look like miai of 1 point, but this is a little mistake as once black gets f2 he has 2 ko threats (e3 and e5), but if white plays f4 and black j11 black only gets 1 ko threat of j10.
]
;B[gi]
C[Uberdude: Important that black doesn't play f9 atari first, it wastes a ko threat and this is sente too. 1-2-3 principle in action!
]
;W[hj]
;B[fp]
;W[jm]
C[Uberdude: And now the deciding ko starts, the winner of this ko wins the game by 0.5!
]
C[Uberdude: Let's count threats.
For black: q2 etc = 4, q13, f9, k11, b3, a2, e3, e5, h16. total = 12.
But note that a2, e5 and h16 threats only threaten another ko.
For white: q15, s15, t14, n13, 19, k4, o19, s5, t6. total = 9.
So it seems that black wins by 3 threats. However, white has a clever tactic: when black plays a2 white should connect at k8 and fight a new bigger ko, as k8 gives white 2 more threats at j5 and l5 (that's why it's important white plays k4 and not m4, you can check that however black answers k4 (e.g. at l5 instead of m4) if white connects at k8 he has 3 threats in that area. So that means black only wins by 12 threats to 11, so if j11 were at f4 white would win by 1 threat and thus the game.
As white needs to switch to the bigger ko at b3, he should play his smallest threats (i.e. n13) first otherwise black will ignore this in the b3 ko. Also there are some complications if black ignores t6 to connect the b3 ko, or amplify it at d2: it's a complicated situation!
]
;B[bq]
C[Uberdude: I want to play the a2 threat as early as possible, to give white the chance to make the mistake of answering it before it's apparent he has to ignore it. It also gives white fewer opportunities to play the n13 small threat.
]
;W[br]
;B[jl]
;W[ro]
C[Uberdude: Similarly white wants to get the t6 ko threat for only a ko played at a time I will answer it.
]
;B[qo]
;W[jm]
;B[ar]
;W[as]
C[Uberdude: Should k8 to generate more threats, as mentioned previously.
]
;B[jl]
;W[sn]
;B[sm]
;W[jm]
;B[eq]
C[Uberdude: This should probably be h16.
]
;W[er]
;B[jl]
;W[ak]
;B[al]
;W[jm]
;B[hd]
C[Uberdude: Last chance for white to ignore one of my threats that only threatens another ko (albeit even bigger than a2).
]
C[Uberdude: This ko is so big n13 is definitely not a threat and maybe o19 and threats on s16 stones aren't either, I didn't count those.
]
;W[gd]
C[Uberdude: Black has now won by 0.5, he has more threats with no chance for white to complicate.
]
;B[jl]
;W[rg]
C[Uberdude: I thought white might try this rather than q15. The idea is if I play s12 t13 then t14 is a careless mistake as it gives white 4 threats (s15 and q15) in this area rather than 3. So if white got 4 threats here and connected at k8 and fought the b3 ko then he would have 12 threats to black's 12 and win the ko and win by 0.5!
]
;B[rh]
;W[jm]
;B[pr]
;W[qr]
;B[jl]
;W[sg]
;B[se]
C[Uberdude: But in fact s13 loses as a point as this good answer at t15 means q15 is no longer sente: even if white wins the ko black now wins.

C[Uberdude: If ever there was an example of the importance of yose, this is it!
]
;W[]
;B[]
C[Uberdude: So due to t13 it ends up as 1.5 rather than the 0.5 it should have been when the ko started. A rather lucky win for me after the g8 blunder.
