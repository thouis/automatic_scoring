C[Uberdude: You like this variation! I know the joseki but have not seen it often. I suppose it leaves the shapes less settled which you like for fighting later?
]
C[quiller: I don't like E3 F6 G5 C2 D6 - and so I stick with this version of the joseki. It's a personal preference.

C[quiller: I expected a move around K4 or G2
]
C[Uberdude: I was happy with that sente exchange for now.
]
;B[qh]
C[Uberdude: so f17?
]
C[quiller: F17 would be my preferred option were I playing B
]
;W[nc]
C[quiller: R8 is not so dangerous, W can live easily and get influence
]
C[Uberdude: Yes, I think I put too much emphasis on the r8 aji, s8 was a good answer I overlooked. Particularly in the way I answered q13 in a locally bad way to keep aiming at r8.
]
;B[pc]
;W[kd]
C[quiller: At this stage I think w is ok R8 and R14 soert of balance out and w is working toward a moyo
]
;B[fc]
;W[ic]
C[Uberdude: Somewhat strange shape I thought. Is the side actually big enough given b gets two decent sized corners?
]
C[quiller: It would have worked better had I played O14 rather than E14

C[Uberdude: Yes, I thought this was a little slow. I didn't think you would want to play o15 as it induces q14 which is nice for b to defend, and o18 still remains at top.
]
;B[ne]
;W[pg]
;B[ph]
C[Uberdude: Maybe just r13 is better, o15 getting cut is big and r8 wasn't so great.

C[Uberdude: Yucky shape, but didn't find anything much better.
]
;W[km]
C[quiller: QAt this stage M17 leads to M16 and the ladder works for W. However, B could play O16 directlyand save O15 in sente which would also help J12. Either that or w allows M17 to become very big and sente
]
;B[li]
C[quiller: The game depends crucially on how well w can attack here. W has a lingering weakness at M17
]
C[Uberdude: I wasn't sure what to do here, maybe cut at m17 straight away as a probe? I thought about some heavier move like k11.
]
C[quiller: This is fine. M17 is vulnerable to M16 - so you want to leave it a little later. This is good to prevent W N11
]
;W[ji]
;B[jh]
;W[kh]
;B[ki]
;W[jj]
C[quiller: M13 carries less risk here for B and threatens to exploit M17 and N15
]

C[quiller: This just seems like a bad exchange for B

C[quiller: E11 has to be very tempting for B
]
C[Uberdude: I think I read it didn't quite work.
]
C[Uberdude: But yes the d10 aji in the game was annoying.
]
C[quiller: It doesn't work work per se, W gets D12 but it does isolate the E12 stones which may need to capture internally
]
;B[dh]
;W[ei]
;B[di]
;W[kc]
C[quiller: reinforces M17 and helps out  after H11 keeping the E11 grp safe
]
;B[gr]
C[Uberdude: I was happy to get this big move, now L4 doesn't look so bad, but m4 was sharp.

C[quiller: complicated sequence here but w has to get something I think. L5 is a nice response to prevent central thinking.

C[quiller: I mean central thickness

;B[rk]
C[quiller: I'm not certain about the wisdom of this for B since it lets W exploit L2. Just S6 is better
]
C[Uberdude: Yes, this was rather rash. I thought I needed more territory to give komi so played it hoping you would answer at q8 here to play safe.
]
;W[rj]
;B[qk]
;W[pj]
;B[ol]
;W[nj]
C[Uberdude: This seems a bit slack, I think I should die; p9 attacks my shape more.
]
C[quiller: True. I just didn't see the sequence that lives, and I was kind of happy with w's overall position.
]
;B[ok]
;W[oj]
;B[ml]
;W[ln]
;B[nk]
C[Uberdude: Silly looking but effective, I felt I would live now. I think you needed to do some peeps and whatnot earlier to destroy my shape.
]
C[quiller: Quite true, I still didn't see the sequence that gave life.

C[quiller: Painful to have to allow the connection but there is a lot of aji surrounding K9 and F8 I didn't want to get into
]
;B[kk]
;W[nh]
;B[jm]
;W[jl]
;B[nn]
C[quiller: Nic`e sequence by B to live. I didn't see this at the start of the sequence
]
;W[op]
;B[oq]
;W[kr]
;B[ls]
C[quiller: This sequence depends strongly on W J3 not working
]
;W[jn]
;B[mn]
C[quiller: W J3 looms here but B has too many external liberties for it to work outright. Though it is close.
]
;W[lo]
;B[lm]
;W[kn]
;B[iq]
C[Uberdude: I regretted this in hindsight, k3 to take a liberty is better, but then I didn't expect you to get into the corner so far.
]
;W[sp]
;B[ck]
C[Uberdude: This move is very big reverse sente, both for territory and also makes sure b3 group easily alive. I played it as I thought you made a mistake to not get it in sente first.
]
C[quiller: I couldn't see how to make it sente. It takes some points but it ends up as gote once you defend D10

;B[rg]
;W[rq]
;B[ea]
;W[fa]
;B[da]
;W[fb]
;B[qr]
C[quiller: D9 is big but gote. I could see no way to play it and keep the initiative, and S2 is a big followup
]
C[Uberdude: w plays c9 in sente, and then maybe continues at b9 or the corner.
]
C[quiller: but after B D10 B can play E7 and F8. W is powerless to resist F6
]
C[Uberdude: Ah yes, I missed that connecting at d10 made that work, so I now agree I should answer in the corner.
]
;W[qq]
;B[pp]
C[Uberdude: Really regretted this one, made after I came home from the pub. I need a breathalyser for my computer! I think s2 is bigger, plus avoids the annoying semedori.
]
C[quiller: I get up at 4:30 in the morning so I often play before I'm really awake - I know the feeling
]
;W[rr]
;B[pr]
;W[rs]
;B[pf]
C[Uberdude: I counted this as 3 points so played it instead of b2, but as s12 remains it's only 2 and a bit.
]
C[quiller: But it is also revers sente

;W[jo]
;B[jp]
;W[pe]
;B[qe]
;W[lk]
;B[ll]

;B[ar]
C[quiller: W has to worry about B M13
]
C[Uberdude: Ah m13 I was hoping though to get m12 m13 n12 o11 n13 in sente and you need to fill in your territory once more after dame filled. So probably should do that before q14.

;W[ns]
;B[os]
;W[ks]
;B[ns]
;W[qs]
;B[js]
C[quiller: W lives but in gote - so this sequence does make points for B. I was hoping to get G1 in sente
]
;W[sr]
;B[in]
;W[im]
;B[fs]
C[Uberdude: Maybe I should play d7 here myself, I didn't realise that I had to defend at b6 later.
]
C[quiller: but G1 is big and sente
