C[integer: anyway
]
C[integer: there are all these girls
]
C[integer: walking up to sad looking guys
]
C[integer: and like inviting them into strip clubs
]
C[integer: i was approached by like four of them
]
C[integer: at various points
]
C[integer: wandering
]
C[paintcan: did you interact
]
C[integer: to the first three i was just like nahh sorry!
]
C[integer: to the fourth i was pretty much like wtf and kinda laughing
]
C[integer: cause i knew as she was approaching me
]
C[integer: her intersect vector
]
C[integer: what was gonna happen / what she wanted
]
C[integer: and she was like super cute, tho looked young enough to make me a creep, bracers and all
]
C[integer: but she was about to say stuff and i just waved it away kinda
]
C[integer: and said nahh i had a book with me i was just gonna find some quiet bar or cafe
]
C[integer: and read
]
C[integer: and said i knew what she was gonna ask
]
C[integer: and she laughed too and said it was fine
]
C[integer: but asked me what i was doing in poland and stuff, initiating conversation
]
C[integer: told her, we talked, she was a student at the university of wroclaw there, studying informatics
]
C[integer: said she loved math but hated c++ ~~~
]
C[integer: how easy it is to fall in love
]
C[paintcan: gotta pay
]
C[integer: yer
]
C[paintcan: for that colege
]
C[integer: well i asked her about that
]
C[integer: and she said it pays really well
]
C[integer: for a student
]
C[paintcan: its probably a better deal
]
C[integer: like if they actually get the guys inside
]
C[paintcan: dont have to strip or prostitute
]
C[integer: as in get the guy to bring them inside, pay cover fees etc
]
C[integer: yeah
]
C[integer: they're basically just like, paid to flirt and be nice
]
C[integer: which i found out very quickly
]
C[paintcan: they escort you, into premises
]
C[integer: cuz she like brought it up after we'd talked for a while
]
C[paintcan: did you follow her
]
C[paintcan: into the den of iniquity
]
C[integer: and was like you've never been to a strip club before?? c'mon! it'll be fun!! etc all enthusiasm and flirtatious
]
C[integer: but as soon as i had vocalized my final nah she was on a vector heading straight toward some other guys
]
C[integer: our love was not made to be
]
C[paintcan: the wealthy norseman and the impoverished pole
]
C[paintcan: its a sad world
]
C[integer: little did she know i was about to like, ask her if she could leave her post and we could go to a bar instead and i'd pay her whatever she made there. paying for someone pretty to talk to me i'm ok with, but a man's gotta draw a line, and paying to sit in a strip club and be sad is too much.
]
C[paintcan: yeah
]
C[paintcan: thats a respectable decision
]
C[integer: she had good english which is rare as well
]
C[paintcan: and your idea wasn't bad
]
C[paintcan: its a shame yo didnt get to share it
]
C[integer: though in her position i'd probably be a little afraid to say yes, seeing as she's probably seen some shit and heard some stories
]
C[integer: of the polish variety
]
C[integer: probably not too many men who want to take her somewhere quieter to teach her how to play twixtpp on grid paper, preach functional programming-- she seemed the rare kind of enthusiastic puzzle minded girl
]
C[paintcan: indeed
]
;B[mn]
;W[ln]
;B[lm]
C[integer: ehh
]
C[integer: spread eagle cut
]
C[integer: but
]
;W[ql]
C[integer: probably gonna fuck this up
]
C[integer: with order or something
]
C[paintcan: a thing is happening
]
C[paintcan: a complex leaning thing
]
C[paintcan: ugh
]
C[integer: yeah well i expect Q7
]
C[integer: or rather
]
C[integer: that's the only thing i considered really
]
C[integer: but and then i "feel" i can live or break out
]
C[integer: one of the two
]
C[paintcan: well, i can play q7 and possibly fall to bits after a horrifically compelx sequence
]
C[paintcan: or i can considering sacrificing q7 somehow, maybe even by a bald tenuki
]
C[paintcan: and perhaps not fall to bits
]
C[integer: a bald tenuki
]
C[paintcan: Q7 looks like it may be an overplay
]
C[paintcan: thats some words i just did say
]
C[integer: i like repeating nice phrases to myself
]
C[integer: my grandmother has some sort of echolalia
]
C[integer: i do not
]
C[integer: verbally
]
C[integer: but in text i like the echo effect
]
C[paintcan: hehe
]
C[paintcan: well, to be honest
]
C[paintcan: your repetition made me question my sanity
]
C[paintcan: and i checked that the defintion of bald which i intended actually existed
]
C[integer: yes america's bald eagle, bald in so many senses
]
C[integer: swooping across the world
]
C[integer: but i think my synapses did something with like temerity for tenuki and together with the bold bald thing
]
C[integer: it was pleasant
]
C[paintcan: a humdinger of a good time
]
C[integer: i looked up wages in poland
]
C[integer: and average wage is like 6 times lower than norway
]
C[integer: live like a king
]
C[paintcan: you could have all the women and food and drugs that you want
]
C[paintcan: just relocate~
]
C[paintcan: but you already have more than enough, so you've complained
]
C[integer: would have to still get paid by norway
]
C[paintcan: thus the technology consultant living in thailand
]
C[integer: i would become fat and alcoholic pretty quickly i feel
]
C[integer: poor impulse control
]
C[paintcan: surf, whore, drink and die
]
C[integer: the place where i come from, the boonies on the west coast of norway
]
C[integer: there's a saying
]
C[integer: "drikka pula spy å slåss" (sic, the homonym confusion that is lost on you anyway is part of its charm)
]
C[integer: meaning "drink fuck puke and fight"
]
C[integer: sums up the place i come from pretty well
]
C[paintcan: very nice
]
C[integer: the cesspool which spat me out
]
C[integer: kids dying from drunk driving, axe murders over amphetamines
]
C[paintcan: sounds like america
]
C[paintcan: time for me to head home, to cook up a domestic feast
]
C[integer: going upstairs at 5am when my parents are away to find my sister comatose and half naked on ghb and some crazy dude with his shirt off who's just spinning around the room and without any sort of contact with reality
]
C[paintcan: chorizo and porkchop with.. beans??
]
C[paintcan: jesus christ
]
C[integer: beer and booze everywhere
]
C[paintcan: a classy hometown
]
C[paintcan: a quiet and peaceful family life
]
C[integer: hehe
]
C[integer: i
]
C[integer: tried to wake my sister, cleaned up what was on the floor
]
C[integer: tried to make sure the guy who was spinning around was partioned away from things standing upright
]
C[integer: and then took my sister's dog for a walk
]
C[paintcan: thats a shitty day
]
C[paintcan: then the drunken crazed man married your sister and they lived happily ever after
]
C[integer: he was high on ghb + amphetamines
]
C[integer: apparently
]
C[integer: my sister came too eventually
]
C[integer: and took care of things
]
C[integer: she is fairly domestic and normal now
]
C[paintcan: thats a desperate combination
]
C[integer: 2 rescued cats, the dog, bunch of fishes
]
C[integer: they're into animals
]
C[paintcan: for when you absolute, positively need to not be who you are
]
C[integer: heh yeah
]
C[paintcan: now i really must run
]
C[integer: good luck
]
C[paintcan: thank you for the slice of life
]
C[integer: on your own domestic feast
]
;B[pm]
C[paintcan: 1 week later - fuck it!
]
C[integer: haha
]
C[integer: do you have a mechanical keyboard?
]
C[integer: got one a while back
]
C[integer: blue keys
]
C[integer: loud as fuck, but nice
]
C[integer: got another one, the red keys, oh god
]
C[integer: typing heaven
]
C[integer: got two more.. one red and brown, planning to ahve the brown at work
]
C[integer: err
]
C[integer: the red one i mean
]
C[integer: the problem is finding keyboards that has both windows keys and the menu key
]
C[integer: + nordic layout so i get an extra key between shift and z instead of just a big fat shift
]
C[integer: the win key i use for xmonad
]
C[integer: and altgr + right winkey + menu key i use for modifiers for my keymap in x
]
C[integer: so i can have like 8 layers of chars in theory
]
C[integer: admittedly i don't use it all
]
C[integer: but also so i don't have to have anything i use a lot on the number row
]
C[integer: cause i hate the number row
]
C[integer: plus can set my own raise/lower volume etc in x
]
C[integer: (and i use the colemak key layout)
]
C[integer: nerd 2 the max
]
C[integer: aalso i recently broke up with (or was dumped, not quite sure what happened) my girlfriend who was... on paper, great for me. sardonic girl who will put with any kind of bullshit, who made music, and whose favorite favorite hobbies include obscure forums where people masturbate to videos of fucked up schizophrenics and aspies on youtube who have like 7 views and weird video games (but mostly fringe indie, adventure/rpg, and like fucked up horror anal child rape animu games, none of which i play).. known each other 3+ years, been together 1.
]
C[integer: sent me into some kind of mixed/mania state. went out in the middle of the night and just kept walking. in the snow and darkness, out of oslo, for hours. it was snowing heavily and i ended up on some mountain, far from people or houses. then i simply turned and went back to work, soaking, covered in snow, pretended like nothing while i sat there smelling like a wet dog all day
]
C[integer: also shaved my entire body for some reason but thankfully stopped when it came to my eyebrows and hair because i remembered i was manic and thus probably doing something crazy that i shouldn't be doing
]
C[integer: drank a liter of vodka, woke up to vomit in my sink. requested 2 weeks vacation for the release date of elder scrolls off.
]
C[integer: i have weird ways of dealing with shit
]
;W[rm]
C[integer: i'm on this drug that's supposed to deal with the mania, like some lithium substitute, but apparently didn't work this time
]
C[integer: also sorry for spam
]
C[paintcan: hmm
]
C[paintcan: sounds like it sucks 2 b crazy
]
C[integer: haha
]
C[paintcan: i have some problems too but they aren't on the same scale
]
C[integer: can't picutre you as the sanest person ever either
]
C[paintcan: sorry about your girlfriend
]
C[paintcan: i understand that
]
C[paintcan: impulse to walk and not stop walking
]
C[integer: but it's a mixed bag. can get away with a lot of bullshit. usually get to lead an "interesting life"... for good or for bad. and sometimes when mania shines from just the right angle and all the moons of jupiter are aligned, you can suck on the titties of afflatus and do great things that make other people think you're a genius.

C[integer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7kdDeGXUjI
]
C[paintcan: damn
]
;B[pl]
C[integer: also sorry about the wall of text. biproduct. also since she was like one of the only two people i talked to pretty frequently, and since i tend to blabber a lot.. things get all scattered and sprayed over other people i come in contact with
]
C[integer: it's like i'm super extraverted online
]
C[paintcan: its ok
]
C[paintcan: it doesn't bother me at all
]
C[integer: even though IRL as they say, i'm like a total shut-in hermit
]
;W[rn]
C[paintcan: i've been you before
]
C[paintcan: i probably still am, since i havent changed
]
C[integer: mostly depression side of stuff?
]
C[integer: or like ups and downs of hypomanic focusing on something, then depression, then hypomanic focusing on something else, etc?
]
C[paintcan: i have wild appetites and little will power, i don't know if depression is more the cause or effect
]
C[integer: be it music, books, go, math, haskell
]
C[paintcan: and no focus
]
C[paintcan: that's what it is like, but diluted by
]
C[paintcan: the pursuit of altered states
]
C[paintcan: food, porn, drugs
]
C[paintcan: just a flawed character
]
;B[nm]
C[integer: i've always seen it as like.. the wild periods of being up for 20 hours coding and forgetting to eat, forgetting everything, all this internal drive, this burning need to solve and figure out and build, and flaming images in your mind about how it's gonna be, turn out, how great, etc. like probably it's the brain burning shit in many ends. and then suddenly i wake up and it's like.. depleted. and there's a disillusionment. it was never gonna be great, it was shit, everything is shit, blah. etc
]
C[integer: and then i have trouble getting out of bed for a week. and then suddently there's this other "spark"
]
C[paintcan: i used to get that
]
C[paintcan: but for me it was more delusional fantasy than anything real
]
C[paintcan: so i've trained myself out of it, and grown out of it too
]
C[integer: but yeah, porn, drugs i understand. food i'm weird about. i eat cold spaghetti out of tins or whatever.
]
C[paintcan: i'm talking about pizza, chinese takeout, food from bags, whatever
]
C[paintcan: garbage consumed more for pleasure than sustenance
]
C[paintcan: internet clicks, television, drugs, food
]
C[paintcan: just a big dopamine wash
]
C[integer: yeah that is way too expensive here. i would no doubt be insanely obese if i lived in the us. i gained like 25-35 pounds in a couple of months of the us
]
C[paintcan: hehe
]
C[integer: i have this thing that i usually just eat once a day
]
C[integer: and then a huge meal
]
C[integer: but in the us i went nuts
]
C[paintcan: there's so much 'good' stuff
]
C[integer: was with an american girl at the time
]
C[integer: had like some 1 pound burger at wherever
]
C[integer: on the way home i asked if we could stop at mcdonald's to "top it off"
]
C[paintcan: haha
]
C[integer: so i got 2 double cheeseburgers and a milkshake
]
C[paintcan: mmm
]
C[integer: she said she threw up in her mouth a little
]
C[paintcan: that's one pleasure with
]
C[integer: i can be really skinny, keep bouncing up and down, but i can eat a fuckton in one sitting.
]
C[paintcan: a low price, that almost anyone can afford
]
C[integer: five guys was like fucking heaven
]
C[integer: mouth orgasm
]
C[integer: and yes to internet clicks too
]
C[integer: hate that
]
C[integer: addictive personality, it's some kind of dopamine cycle thing
]
C[integer: high risk for gambling addictions, drug addiction, etc etc
]
C[paintcan: its teh worst
]
C[paintcan: itd be nice to be able to just
]
C[paintcan: reach into your own source code and erase the flaws
]
C[paintcan: i feel like i've lived the same 2 or 3 terrible years a few times over now
]
C[paintcan: not uniformly terrible, a lot of good things too, but it feels like there's no progress
]
C[paintcan: can't rise above the noise of these cycles, barely self aware
]
C[paintcan: fff
]
C[integer: well.. yeah. when i was young i thought it was a blessing. because it also correlates highly with being creative, adaptable, quick learner, etc. more with age that i might have started to wish i was more... baseline, normal. being able to have routine without feeling like i was dying inside.
]
C[integer: the whole thing that i looked upon as being a drone when i was a kid. go to work, make my money, come home, relax with games or whatever i want to watch, some book. rinse repeat. nothing crazy, no sudden homelessness, no relationship rollercoasters, etc. nothing too tiring.
]
C[integer: the worst part is, of course, having that stack of like 34981023 old projects or ideas or things you began, but never finished. having that towering over you, threatening to fall over and crush you. but if only there was a way to make me less scared of it, make me feel less like a failure everytime i think of it.
]
C[integer: just in programming, compilers i wanted to write, libraries, implementations of every kind of thing in every kind of language, web games, hell, operating system i wanted to write (when i was naive enough).
]
C[integer: not to mention all the other fields i've thrown myself into
]
;W[pk]
C[paintcan: i definitely understand what you speak of
]
;B[ok]
C[integer: ever heard of meyers briggs personality types?
]
C[paintcan: yes, i'm le intp
]
C[integer: guessing you as an INTP like moi
]
C[integer: hehe yeh
]

;B[nk]
;W[mp]
C[paintcan: n3 was probably
]
C[paintcan: the move
]
C[integer: for me?
]
C[paintcan: for me
]
C[paintcan: but its hard to ignore p10
]
;B[oq]
C[integer: hmm yeah n3 looks super sente
]
C[paintcan: at least
]
C[paintcan: life is pretty good
]
C[integer: hmmmm
]
C[paintcan: all these terrible appetites ruining my life are very enjoyable, taken a moment at a time
]
;W[or]
C[integer: i am kind of tempted by this
]
;B[mq]
C[integer: oh
]
C[paintcan: well, i'll play simply
]
C[integer: not expected
]
;W[op]
C[integer: did the chinese fellow accept any game?
]
C[integer: i think he's actually pretty worried about his win/loss statistics
]
C[integer: like that's a huge deal to him it seems
]
C[integer: and afaik it counts a bit on some of those asian servers?
]
C[integer: beyond just being statistics
]
C[paintcan: i haven't sent him a challenge yet
]
C[paintcan: its on my procrastination list
]
C[integer: speaking of procrastination lists
]
C[integer: i was in contact with fishers and they said they didn't send outside of us unless it was some kind of military base (??)
]
C[integer: is there like a trade embargo on crack popcorn now
]
C[paintcan: haha
]
C[integer: but anyway that i should call them and maybe we could "work something out"
]
C[integer: but yeah this popcorn will fuck you up
]
C[integer: given your personality
]
C[paintcan: hahaa
]
C[integer: do you play any other games by the way. board games or video games. or have i asked you that before, can't remember
]
C[paintcan: mm, im somewhat afk for dinner now - but before i go, i can tell you `not really1`
]
C[paintcan: just counterstrike in the beforetimes
]
C[integer: ah
]
C[integer: k
]
C[integer: do you cook? that's why i eat crap. hate making food. even 20 minutes feels too long
]
C[integer: and then cleaning up
]
C[paintcan: my girlfriend mostly cooks
]
C[paintcan: if it falls to me, i order take out too often
]
C[paintcan: it is the same for me
]
C[paintcan: a recipe that should take 40 minute sfrom start to end takes me 2 hours, because i can't sit my ass down and just do it
]
;B[no]
C[integer: a girlfriend who cooks, now that sounds nice
]
;W[nq]
C[integer: i'm like 1d 2d every other game
]
C[integer: ought to be some grace thresholds
]
;B[nr]
C[paintcan: ive robbed you too many times
]
C[integer: well that's tempting
]
C[integer: not sure who is ko master here
]
C[integer: i should have some around F3 for a little gain at least
]
C[paintcan: darn it, anaylsis :(
]
C[integer: and C9 shit
]
C[paintcan: i think you are ko master
]
C[integer: hmm
]
C[paintcan: does that me this bad?
]
C[paintcan: mek*
]
C[integer: but once i run out of local.. and if you
]
C[integer: kill
]
C[integer: K3
]
C[integer: then it's a huge ko
]
C[integer: and not sure how many huge kos i have
]
C[integer: threatst

]
C[integer: so stong
]
C[paintcan: still, ill enjoy this 3d for the brief time it lasts
]
C[integer: hehe
]
C[paintcan: we should rematches
]
C[integer: at one point i had two active accounts on kgs
]
C[integer: one was 4d and one was 2k
]
C[integer: both blitz
]
C[paintcan: i have 5 right now, or 6?
]
C[paintcan: they are all _barely_ 2d
]
C[integer: most i've ever had is 2 active
]
C[integer: usually i just had 1 forever
]
C[paintcan: i used to do a lot, and i had a few solid 3d back in ye day
]
C[integer: i mean for like 4 years or something
]
C[integer: yeh
]
C[paintcan: thats the right way to do it probably
]
C[integer: know some people on kgs who have so many accounts
]
C[paintcan: but im a bitch
]
C[paintcan: i like to spread my luck around
]
C[integer: fucking notepad files to keep track of them all
]
C[paintcan: and if im playing shitty
]
C[paintcan: just dump all my games into 1 acct
]
C[paintcan: the Shit acuont
]
C[integer: i was okvonnegut since forever. it even has like, my first games of go
]
C[paintcan: weak pussies have more than 2 accounts, mark my word
]
C[integer: beyond the two or three i played on yahoo games
]
C[paintcan: same for my wossname!
]
C[paintcan: er, not true
]
C[integer: but then i lost it :(
]
C[paintcan: my very first was randolm, on kgs
]
C[paintcan: have some solid 30k games there
]
C[paintcan: its never lost to the archives..
]
C[integer: yeah have lots of 30 kyu stuff
]
C[integer: funny to revisit
]
C[paintcan: there's a guy bonklers
]
C[paintcan: and i played him, 30k vs 30k
]
C[paintcan: back when i started
]
C[paintcan: hes 1d now i think
]
C[integer: and then see my like, "crack"
]
C[paintcan: funny to see that
]
C[integer: around 7-10 kyu or wherever it was
]
C[integer: when i just switched to blitz
]
C[paintcan: blitz & tsumegos
]
C[paintcan: really pure
]
C[integer: before that was like a couple of games a week, super anxiety
]
C[paintcan: thats my style
]
C[integer: every game felt like taking some kind of exam of my own worth
]
C[paintcan: super anxiety man
]
C[paintcan: well, not now
]
C[integer: yeah
]
C[paintcan: but all my games since returning
]
C[paintcan: have been shitty
]
C[paintcan: keep losing by 10+ points in fuseki
]
C[integer: hehe
]
C[paintcan: and winning thru bullshit inventions
]
C[paintcan: if i win
]
C[paintcan: otherwise its just a boring 10 point loss
]
C[integer: at one point i played blitz straight for like 20 hours
]
C[integer: just numbing
]
C[paintcan: there s that guy, aeroplane
]
C[paintcan: once i played
]
C[integer: yeah i know him
]
C[paintcan: the betting baduk with hi
]
C[paintcan: m
]
C[paintcan: i forget name
]
C[integer: talked to him a couple of weeks ago actually
]
C[paintcan: for real money
]
C[paintcan: i lost 60 dollars in a night
]
C[paintcan: and lost our friendship for a while
]
C[paintcan: because i was so mad
]
C[integer: he uhh, "stole" my internet girlfriend way back when, hehe. which you also probably know, kaitlyn
]
C[paintcan: the games just got histtier and shittier
]
C[paintcan: yeah i know of kaitlyn and you
]
C[paintcan: the internet love triangle
]
C[integer: hehe
]
C[paintcan: i was internet friends with kaitlyn for a bit, later
]
C[integer: i couldn't even be properly mad cause he seemed like such a nice guy
]
C[paintcan: i was so angry with jon then because
]
C[paintcan: he was stolen by kaitlyn
]
C[paintcan: i lost my internet friend
]
C[paintcan: to the succubus from australia
]
C[integer: daw
]
C[integer: girlfriends is #1 cause of internet friendship death
]
C[integer: but kaitlyn also turned like kinda crazy
]
C[paintcan: i jave no idea what really happened
]
C[integer: have talked to her a bunch of times over the years
]
C[paintcan: but it was not good for jon
]
C[paintcan: and now she has a baby with a piercings man, plus sheis a doctor
]
C[integer: some kind of lab research thing?
]
C[integer: but she's so.. ugh
]
C[paintcan: i dunno exactly what, but she has doctor medical degree
]
C[paintcan: very smart lady
]
C[integer: she can be really fucked up
]
C[paintcan: jon loved her and she trampled him to pieces, or osmething
]
C[paintcan: i dont eevne remember what happen
]
C[integer: like she told me she'd cybersex randoms even when she was with jon (don't tell him that if he has like a fond view of her)
]
C[integer: yeah
]
C[paintcan: i dont think his view of her is hte fondest
]
C[paintcan: but he didn't get over the relationship for a very long time
]
C[paintcan: he was a man in ruins
]
C[paintcan: that is pretty fucked up
]
C[paintcan: o,
]
C[paintcan: ..,,
]
C[integer: and she'd talk to me too, and like just oscillate between being all come to australia and fuck me, and tell me about all the tough guys she's fucking now and it's so good to have sex with REAL MEN not like pussy nerds
]
C[paintcan: she played mind games like that with you?
]
C[integer: after jon that is
]
C[integer: ha, oh yes
]
C[integer: she could be very mind gamey
]
C[paintcan: i knew she has that deviant internet humor
]
C[paintcan: elusive and great
]
C[paintcan: but that does not sound very nice
]
C[integer: nyaaa.. she also had like this insane drive to want to be an internet cool person
]
C[paintcan: that's part of the internet deviant humor thing a lot of the time
]
C[integer: she absolutely haaated other girls on the internet. fucking attention whore bitches.
]
C[paintcan: lol
]
C[integer: and then she'd do a lot of the same shit
]
C[paintcan: well, she was only ever nice to me, but she didn't want me to fly halfway across the world and sex her
]
C[integer: hehe
]
C[integer: yeah cause you're an internet cool person
]
C[integer: she spoke fondly of you
]
C[paintcan: I Used To Be Cool
]
C[integer: i was never really mad at jon. though i still did get a bit fucked up where i like drank vodka every day and just played EVE and shit.
]
C[paintcan: the grey days
]
C[integer: but wasn't the happiest relationship to begin with either
]
C[paintcan: well, you kind of dodged a bullet sort of i guess
]
C[integer: mhm
]
C[paintcan: maybe the bullet would never have harmed you like it did jon though
]
C[paintcan: he's also a man of moods, but largely the grey ones 
]
C[integer: well, depends on how you look at it. after her.. i met that one person who was like The One or whatever bullshit cliches
]
C[paintcan: he doesn't get the manic upswing
]
C[integer: and has forever fucked me up
]
C[paintcan: theres a girl shaped hole in your heart forever?
]
C[integer: the 1 in a billion kind of perfect girl. who for some reason fell in love with me, albeit only for the duration of the limerence
]
C[paintcan: there are a lot of nice and not so nice girls
]
C[integer: after her i've also had a bunch of relationships, but it's all... i wish i could eternal sunshine of the spotless mind that one
]
C[paintcan: :(
]
C[integer: cause she showed me a world that nothing else can really compare to, and i'll always just be stuck wanting
]
C[paintcan: did she have Art
]
C[paintcan: or Beliefs? Politics?
]
C[integer: yeah, she was a really good painter, could draw, could write, played go (was about 2 kyu then, about 1+d now i think). also interested in lots of other board games and shit. that problem solving puzzle oriented mind i think i mentioned.
]
C[paintcan: i dated a communist for a very short period of time, and it did a number on me
]
C[paintcan: because she rejected most of the catholic moral foundations i was brought up with
]
C[paintcan: but not like that, i see
]
C[paintcan: just a brilliant soul then
]
C[integer: her whole family is like... her sister is or was art director for a huge film festival, her other sister was a translator in latin america, both have published stories. her father a novelist and english professor, her mother a painter and poetess..
]
C[integer: i have a big hardon for literature (like normal literature, modern classics, whatever). and she's the first i encountered who was more well read than i, and not all like "lol math is hard lol" kind of girl
]
C[integer: and she was beautiful, of course. all the genes.. naturally skinny, whatever. shy in that cute way, super nice and caring. blah
]
C[paintcan: that's a rare quality, to bridge both worlds
]
C[paintcan: somedays i like to daydream that i could be less of a piece of shit and read Real Books
]
C[integer: also played an instrument, could speak french
]
C[paintcan: but like most people, i don't travel very far in either
]
C[paintcan: it is nice to know people who do though
]
C[integer: her family was all kinds of fucked up like supportive and weird.. artists. as opposed to my family
]
C[integer: owned some farmhouse out on the orkney islands
]
C[integer: where we went
]
C[integer: this old house full of books
]
C[paintcan: wealthy and beautiful and intelligent
]
C[integer: and the sea around us
]
C[paintcan: there is oinly one real world,, and ours is but a shadow
]
C[integer: so unlike my family. when we went there she was all worried about like, what was she gonna do after school etc. and her mother was just aahhh don't think about that.. take some years, just sit and read, enjoy life. take stuff in. etc
]
C[integer: and i just wanted to hug her and say i wish she was my mother
]
C[paintcan: you tasted the real world
]
C[paintcan: and now you're stuck with us shades
]
C[integer: i tasted the world that existed only in books and movies
]
C[integer: we also went to the film festival her sister was a director of
]
C[integer: red carpet entrance
]
C[paintcan: a few hundred real people
]
C[integer: could have spit on sean connory if i wanted
]
C[paintcan: careening about on yachs
]
C[paintcan: enjoying private parties
]
C[paintcan: writing letters of importance
]
C[paintcan: the rest just backdrops
]
C[integer: and in edinburgh all we did in the evenings was sit around playing this elaborate board game with two friends. making up our own rules because we didn't think the official rules were fun enough
]
C[integer: ~~sigh~~
]
C[paintcan: hm
]
C[paintcan: you are very nearly a real person yourself, integer
]
C[paintcan: with all this going about you do
]
C[integer: all these fucked up things, amids being an unhappy wage slave
]
C[paintcan: that nerd notch? could have been You
]
C[integer: we broke up at an european go congress. she wrote me a letter and handed it to me and told me to read it
]
C[integer: still have it
]
C[paintcan: how many years ago?
]
C[integer: 5
]
C[integer: groningen
]
C[integer: she went back to her ex
]
C[integer: who is basically a clone of me
]
C[integer: only not fucked up, not diseased
]
C[integer: a smiling, undepressed, and stable version of me
]
C[paintcan: you, the inferior cast shadow from his flame
]
C[integer: other than that we're so similar it's kind of creepy
]
C[integer: like in mannerisms, habits, what not
]
C[paintcan: suppose that makes sense
]
C[integer: even weird little things, like how i had divided up my go problems in a specific way in go grinder and he had the exact same thing
]
C[paintcan: she always had access to what she liked
]
C[integer: liked the same games, liked similar music
]
C[integer: when the game WYPS was first released on little golem
]
C[paintcan: as unusual as you are, if you have enoguh people, it's bound to happen
]
C[integer: her and i were the strongest players on the site~
]
C[integer: she won the first wyps championship
]
C[paintcan: Players of Games
]
C[integer: it's kind of like a word game with elements from hex. i.e. abstract strategy + word games
]
C[integer: and we loved both word games and abstracts
]
C[paintcan: looks like a mix of hex and scrabble
]
C[integer: ye
]
C[paintcan: well, a girl like that was with you
]
C[paintcan: you're probably quite a catch
]
C[integer: yeah that's one thing it did
]
C[integer: boosted my confidence into the sky
]
C[integer: but still
]
C[paintcan: maybe you can write a dating website built around abstract puzzle games
]
C[paintcan: where matches are made based on inferred cognition scores in different categories
]
C[paintcan: and the real secret purpose is to find a replacement
]
C[paintcan: for her
]
C[integer: call me crazy but i kind of think it would be like, me and 9 other aspies on that site
]
C[integer: no matter my marketing budget
]
C[paintcan: a lot of people love that catan shit
]
C[paintcan: and all teh other games
]
C[paintcan: might be a few thousands aspies
]
C[integer: she destroyed me in those
]
C[integer: she was not an impatient blitzer like i. she was a careful thinker
]
C[paintcan: Pattern Recognition
]
C[paintcan: it's not enough
]
C[paintcan: hate those people who can actually think so clearly
]
C[paintcan: high general games aptitude
]
C[integer: mm
]
C[integer: good thing i didn't sully her future gene pool
]
C[integer: with adhd-bipolar-aspie-depression-addiction-whatever shit
]
C[paintcan: if you marry someone normal
]
C[paintcan: you may have merely intelligent children
]
C[paintcan: you should probably try to breed for good looks
]
C[integer: merely intelligent people become lawyers, and they do indeed rule the world
]
C[paintcan: and happiness
]
C[integer: what are you breeding for
]
C[integer: good cooking
]
C[paintcan: haha
]
C[paintcan: happiness more than anything
]
C[integer: happiness is good
]
C[integer: let me know when you unlock the secret of contentment
]
C[integer: if you haven't already
]
C[paintcan: not for me
]
C[paintcan: btu maybe for future children
]
C[paintcan: but yaeh, if i find it in the dirt somelpace
]
C[paintcan: ill sahre it
]
C[integer: or well, hope you have someone with you to make sure you don't cook it up and inject it straight into our veins, as people like us are wont to do when we find some speck of happiness.
]
C[integer: your*
]
C[paintcan: hahaha
]
C[paintcan: did you see that vice bit
]
C[paintcan: about the junkies in czech-land
]
C[integer: no
]
C[paintcan: hm
]
C[paintcan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdYZj9vmfi0
]
C[paintcan: i think you'd probably watch this; i did
]
C[integer: oh yeah, did you see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9huWlXFA1s
]
C[integer: scared the shit out of me because it made me really want to do heroin
