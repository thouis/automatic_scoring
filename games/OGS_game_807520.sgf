C[xhu98: this is only my second 9x9 @_@

C[wurfmaul: Oh, really? I have played over 200 probably. But I don't know how much of an advantage that will give.

C[wurfmaul: thank you
]
C[xhu98: thank you :)
]
C[xhu98: I turned that one around
]
C[wurfmaul: maybe you can show me which moves you feared?
]
C[xhu98: in the beginning
]
C[xhu98: Because I was confined to the top right corner
]
C[xhu98: D6 was a desperate move
]
C[wurfmaul: but I obviously found it difficult to handle
]
C[xhu98: B6 would do I think
]
C[xhu98: this. From move 18: B6 D5 E4 E5 F5 
]
C[wurfmaul: oh, hm
]
C[wurfmaul: interesting.
]
C[xhu98: My F7 was bad
]
C[xhu98: Should have just mirrored your move xP
]
C[wurfmaul: Sounds reasonable
]
C[xhu98: My theory of approaching smaller boards is still forming xP
]
C[wurfmaul: it's already as good as mine
]
C[xhu98: White 28 was a good move I think
]
C[wurfmaul: Maybe black should answer a4?
]
C[xhu98: White A3?
]
C[wurfmaul: black a5?
]
C[xhu98: White A7
]
C[xhu98: Oh okay
]
C[xhu98: Black has one more liberty I think
]
C[wurfmaul: maybe
]
C[xhu98: Black can play at E8 first
]
C[xhu98: So that White won't be able to fill in that corner liberty
]
C[wurfmaul: Yes, I saw that in a variation that I put on the board
]
C[wurfmaul: on my private board
]
C[wurfmaul: there are surely many variations
]
C[xhu98: analyze mode?
]
C[wurfmaul: yes
]
C[xhu98: In the game I got A4
]
C[xhu98: Which was huge imo
]
C[wurfmaul: Yes, I don't see a good way for black after white gets a4
]
C[xhu98: yup
]
C[xhu98: Black F4 maybe?
]
C[wurfmaul: an exchange?
]
C[xhu98: Yep
]
C[wurfmaul: black will capture the lower right and white the lower left?
]
C[xhu98: White captures the top left
]
C[xhu98: Then Black might still end up with more than half of the board?
]
C[wurfmaul: seems close to me, but I feel white wins i.e. I hope white wins
]
C[xhu98: yeah it's gonna be close anyways
]
C[xhu98: It's 9x9 :)
]
C[wurfmaul: surely better for black than the game
]
C[wurfmaul: h
]
C[wurfmaul: oops. Thanks for the game and the review.
]
C[xhu98: Haha thanks
]
C[xhu98: Well played
]
C[wurfmaul: You too. Bye!
]
C[xhu98: o/
]
C[Marnoris: another another :D
]
C[Marnoris: it's a match in 2 won games :)
]
C[ssx: nice game :D i thought that black could have win
