]
C[Plunder: yes, I misread, didn't check S8

C[Plunder: thank you for the game
]
C[xhu98: So it WAS the bottom right
]
C[Plunder: >.<
]
C[xhu98: Thank you very much
]
C[Plunder: you are welcome :P
]
C[xhu98: You were in control
]
C[Plunder: I felt it was a good game for me yes
]
C[xhu98: My move at S18 was bad
]
C[xhu98: Then you got the vital point for expanding the center
]
C[Plunder: I think the bottom joseki was good for me
]
C[xhu98: Yes
]
C[xhu98: You gained a lot of potential
]
C[Plunder: With Q3 H4 is actually a mistake
]
C[Plunder: I learned once a long time ago
]
C[xhu98: H4?
]
C[Plunder: because H4 looses a liberty that you need in a situation that can arise
]
C[xhu98: Oh okay
]
C[xhu98: See, I'm bad at openings :)
]
C[xhu98: Chances are I shouldn't even choose the joseki when Q3 is occupied
]
C[Plunder: true
]
C[Plunder: why didnyou play D3?
]
C[Plunder: here?. From move 51: D3 
]
C[Plunder: something like this?. From move 51: D3 D2 C4 B2 B3 C2 C10 
]
C[xhu98: I was afraid of C5
]
C[Plunder: aaah
]
C[xhu98: Then if you get started on the left side
]
C[xhu98: Could be bad for me
]
C[Plunder: I see
]
C[xhu98: I didn't choose G5
]
C[xhu98: Because it's gote and there's aji
]
C[Plunder: ah yes
]
C[xhu98: If I were Black, I'd probably play at M14
]
C[xhu98: Sometime
]
C[xhu98: Cosmic style :)
]
C[Plunder: haha :D
]
C[xhu98: What do you think of the mid-game?
]
C[Plunder: cosmic style is fun, but rarely really works :P
]
C[Plunder: I think I could have played a bit sharper in the invasion at the top
]
C[xhu98: Yeah, maybe
]
C[xhu98: I could accept the result in the game
]
C[Plunder: I have a lot of influence, but I can  really use it :)
]
C[Plunder: maybe better?. From move 76: K18 
]
C[xhu98: Yeah
]
C[xhu98: G18 is sente then
]
C[xhu98: At move 101,
]
C[Plunder: ah yes
]
C[Plunder: there was some idea that didn work with me playing on S7 afterwards
]
C[xhu98: that was a great move
]
C[Plunder: I don't think it worked as well as I planned :D
]
C[xhu98: T5 is a tesuji
]
C[xhu98: But tbh what I thought was S5
]
C[xhu98: Sorry, S6
]
C[Plunder: how does it work then?
]
C[xhu98: That could have killed my entire group
]
C[xhu98: S6 is sente, and it prevents two eyes
]
C[Plunder: ah yes
]
C[xhu98: So I was grateful to live
]
C[xhu98: White 124 should fix the tesuji directly
]
C[Plunder: it was too hard to actually kill, so I was happy you did a slow move there :P
]
C[xhu98: White 126 was the losing move
]
C[Plunder: I think it was huge!
]
C[Plunder: I wanted to play there
]
C[xhu98: But it's gote
]
C[xhu98: And F8 is massive
]
C[Plunder: yes :)
]
C[xhu98: When I saw that
]
C[Plunder: I was surprised by B10 
]
C[Plunder: why the empty triangle?
]
C[Plunder: move 114
]
C[xhu98: Because sente :)
]
C[xhu98: But not really
]
C[xhu98: In terms of endgame, yes, but not in the game
]
C[Plunder: ah
]
C[Plunder: endgame tesuji?
]
C[xhu98: Not tesuji, but if Black tenukies
]
C[xhu98: White can monkey jump at A13
]
C[xhu98: Which is tremendous
]
C[Plunder: and a sente monkey
]
C[xhu98: Yeehah
]
C[xhu98: B4 was also huge
]
C[Plunder: exactly 
]
C[xhu98: Well, move 136, I already lost my thoughts xD
]
C[Plunder: I was afraid of my own group at the top a bit
]
C[xhu98: S13 is good, it keep the group safe
]
C[Plunder: I need to play it :(
]
C[xhu98: And now you can play at H12
]
C[xhu98: And reduce my top territory as well as expanding yours
]
C[Plunder: anyway, I will move on to something else :) Thank you for the game. I hope we will meet again! :D
]
C[Plunder: byebye!
]
C[xhu98: Alright, see you
]
C[xhu98: Tourney 3058 has started
]
C[Plunder: see you =)
]
C[xhu98: You want to watch and do kibitz
]
C[xhu98: ?
]
C[Plunder: I don't know it
]
C[Plunder: but I was going to do some other things now
]
C[Plunder: so, not somuch kibitz for me at least :D
]
C[xhu98: Alright, have a good day then :D
