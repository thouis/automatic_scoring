C[Uberdude: Normally I would pincer to prevent the big black moyo, but I was inspired by Gu Li's games in which he calmly builds his own side and then invades ferociously.

C[Uberdude: When black cut here I thought he would then extend at o11 to fight.
]
;W[og]
;B[lg]
C[Uberdude: Maybe black thought I would play honte at o11, and by putting in the atari he gets m12 sente, whereas without the atari white could connect at o12 and answer m12 with a hane or tenuki. A downside of the atari is black p15 loses power, but that seems minor detail and likely to be white's privilege anyhow. The important thing was if I spent a move here and black got to defend at r6 I felt bad.
]
;W[po]
C[Uberdude: Trying to attack r9 on a large scale, to make up for the large territory (not quite 100% secure) black made on the top side.
]
;B[ni]
;W[oj]
C[Uberdude: I have to come out here rather than follow up on corner otherwise black seals me in and connects to r9 in sente. This shape looks funny, but it seemed the best to me using the n12 aji.
]
;B[ol]
;W[mj]
C[Uberdude: And this looks even weirder, an already-peeped one point jump, but I spent a long time trying to find the best move and this seemed better than o10 at the time as black can't push through yet. But it does leave very bad aji as was exploited later in the game.
]
;B[np]
C[Uberdude: o3 could also be possible here; although it looks soft it stops white leaning to attack r9.

C[Uberdude: Hard to find the move here: if o10 instead I didn't like black getting n6.

C[Uberdude: I didn't actually consider this answer.
]
;W[pk]
;B[nj]
;W[pm]
;B[lp]
C[Uberdude: I was happy enough to end the complex fighting with this sente trade and kill r9, but n10 looks silly now (though not useless as the game showed!) and the white territory is not so huge with the t5 monkey jump. Black is very strong on the outisde so has further potential but white is only inside so I think black is slightly better. Nevertheless, 4th line territory in black's former moyo, sente, and the l7 weakness aren't to be sniffed at.
]
;W[hc]
C[Uberdude: But I think this is a big mistake in direction, and my other idea of d9 would be better, but then black could f15 and it seemed like the entire top side would become territory. In Gu Li's game he invaded the top even after black got f15, but n12 was alive in his game which helps the invasion. d9 would not only grow my moyo, but help stop black making centre points, or if he does I make a lot on the side in return.

;B[dk]
C[Uberdude: With that 'joseki' sequence on the top black usually has to defend at k15 but now his nearby strength means he doesn't. The game felt hard to white now.
]
;W[dm]
;B[dc]
C[Uberdude: I was surprised black didn't help d9, but maybe it's already a good exchange to prevent white d9 as d7 doesn't actually make so many points for white: there is still a big problem in the corner at c4. I was relieved black never tried anything there in the game. If black c12 I was planning to defend at f16 or maybe g15 aiming at k15, so this was annoyingly timed.
]

C[Uberdude: I didn't feel I could compromise and had to make a big corner and save j17.

C[Uberdude: I can't remember my plan if black g18, cut and ko?
]
;W[ea]
C[Uberdude: This result seems fine for black who reduced in sente and helped grow middle, though white did get the corner which was open to invasion before. There are cuts still at f13 and k15, but with the centre black strength they seemed unlikely to go well for me.

C[Uberdude: Dangerous but necessary was my judgement.
]
;B[em]
;W[dl]
;B[ek]
;W[hj]
;B[hn]
C[Uberdude: As well as attacking the centre stones, I was worried about black doing evil things to my lower left corner with the d6 thinness.
]
;W[jm]
;B[jk]
C[Uberdude: It's so ugly and bad shape, but can black push and cut at j7 then k8?

C[Uberdude: An idea from Gu Li, though he used it to invade, I just for sente yose.

;W[jb]
;B[kb]
;W[ib]
;B[lc]
;W[hh]
C[Uberdude: I wondered if I should get in the e8 atari before losing e6 (as I thought this jump was bigger than e5 defence) to create a cut at f9 which might make f13 more interesting, but decided against it. Black can always defend the cut in sente with f9 but that loses points in the centre when I answer at j10.

C[Uberdude: Although black got a sente ponnuki, my corner is safe now.
]
;B[ih]
;W[ll]
;B[lk]
;W[gr]
C[Uberdude: I wanted to get t15 4 points double sente first, but feared black would omit s16 to play this kosumi and it would be submissive to answer, but after several mutual tenukis black goes into the corner and kills my entire group, where when I go into the top right nothing black dies, just points.
]
;B[so]
C[Uberdude: Black's right.
]
;W[sq]
C[Uberdude: This way of answering the monkey jump stops t2 eye so p3 aji is more interesting.
]
;B[rq]
;W[rp]
;B[sp]
;W[sn]
;B[sr]
;W[ro]
;B[sq]
C[Uberdude: But this is a mistake as it costs liberties and it is always black's sente later. In pro games you often see this connect later.

C[Uberdude: A clever move that defends the l2 cut and the p3 sente yose, but the aji is bad and black must remember to take care.

;B[fp]
;W[ep]
C[Uberdude: There's still a problem with g4 and l2.
]
;B[bl]
C[Uberdude: Before this move it was hard to count the left side but I thought black was about 6 points ahead.

;W[op]
;B[oq]
C[Uberdude: Maybe this could be called the losing move as l2 now works. Not all my time tesujis are simple to answer.
]
;W[oi]
C[Uberdude: Tough to pick this or b10. I seem to recall counting this as slightly bigger, and also maybe black doesn't see c10.
]
;B[cm]
C[Uberdude: This lost 1 point, direct c10 better. Though I suppose the liberty shortage did make d5 sente so perhaps not... We both made a mistake in the timing of d5.

;W[cm]
;B[hp]
C[Uberdude: The bad aji of l2 constrains black here, but given it works anyway with n3 (I didn't find that move until a bit later) just j5 block should be better?
]
;W[kr]
;B[ls]
;W[lr]
;B[ms]
;W[mm]
C[Uberdude: This could well be me losing move. I played this rather than n3 because in the variation where black answers n4 at m5 and sacrifices o4, m5 is sente for n7 push and cut to kill my centre. But this loses p12 sente which is a sente point plus good aji and then black chose the other variation after n3. My thought was if I play this after black m5 then if black ignores this to o4 I have lost points on the bottom, but that is bogus logic as black loses more in the centre if I get n9 anyway.

;B[lq]
;W[gg]
;B[gf]
;W[ig]
;B[hf]
;W[fg]
C[Uberdude: Another mistake: the n3 tesuji meant even with n7 I was ahead, but with this move I thought I had thrown the game away after working to hard to claw it back.
]
C[Uberdude: e12 is better: white keeps more points in c12 area and black still has to k15 defend after dame.

C[Uberdude: White's shape suffers
]
;W[fh]
;B[dg]

C[Uberdude: Needed to prevent black's tesuji at a14 as my shape sucks now. When I played f13 I expected to get sente for d5.

C[Uberdude: If I had realised this was sente, I would have played it earlier (and black should too).

C[Uberdude: Black should g11 2 pts sente first.
]
;W[io]
;B[ho]
;W[gj]
;B[ga]
C[Uberdude: I'd missed this makes k19 3 instead of 2 points, but wastes another threat.
]
;W[da]
;B[om]
;W[on]
;B[pf]
C[Uberdude: q15 wasn't quite sente for white according to my reading (black crawls along s16/17 etc to live with 4 space eye and even though white connects to o17 it dies inside) and the game was so close I couldn't afford to bluff and be called. It would creates loads of ko threats though.
]
;W[pg]
;B[pe]
;W[kp]
C[Uberdude: Mistake too to waste threat: with a8 still there it would be a mistake for black to play here so no rush.
]
;B[kq]
;W[ka]
C[Uberdude: This is 3 points (I spend 1 move inside to avoid seki, vs 2 if black gets it) and also creates a lot of ko threats, whereas black q14 was just 2 so a mistake.
]
;B[la]
;W[ja]
;B[am]
C[Uberdude: If black connects at a11 white gets a8 and wins by 0.5.
]
;W[an]
;B[al]

C[Uberdude: So this ko is for the game. At this point I thought black had more threats so would win.

C[Uberdude: So many threats!
]
;W[bd]
;B[ah]
;W[pp]
C[Uberdude: I realised if black fills the ko and I get the last point at j4 I win by 0.5. This means lots of 1 point yose moves become my ko threats so I win the game.

;B[ik]
;W[hk]

C[Uberdude: Losing this liberty helped my ko threats inside.

;W[gi]
;B[ah]

C[Uberdude: This sequence gives black 2 extra prisoners, but ended up with 2 points of semedori so had no cost but created many threats, but I think black made a mistake and it should cost a point for white.
