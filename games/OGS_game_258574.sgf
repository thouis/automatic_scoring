C[Uberdude: The most orthodox move here for black would be to approach the d3 stone, but if black can exchange c14 for f17 that will likely help with the c6 d5 b4 c8 d6 variations to attack c8.

C[Uberdude: So white naturally pincers, the bottom left corner is the focus.

C[Uberdude: Maybe white should c8 here.

C[Uberdude: And use sente to reduce the influence white got.

C[Uberdude: Honte would be r8, but that felt a bit slow. Splitting here is big as now that b4 is settled, d3 can be a weak group.
]
;W[hq]
C[Uberdude: This feels bad, it makes black stronger and doesn't make much points or base with n2 open. Just jump at k6 feels better. Though of course black might then get k3 and it seems like double sente for a few points and a bit of a base. But my feeling is a pro would never play this sort of attachment.

C[Uberdude: @Celebrir, maybe white can live with b3, but then there is a cut at d4. As you saw in game later, white can live locally, but it is painful.
]
C[Uberdude: I did consider playing c3, it is a rally big point and if white answers at d2 it's a good exchange for black. But white has a good answer at e2, threatening g2, so if black g2 to cut he loses sente.
]
;W[el]
;B[mr]
C[Uberdude: I decide not to help my weak group directly, but take this huge point, which also makes k4 weaker   so white can't attack so severely.

C[Uberdude: These peeps are good as they stop black e10 being effective, which would both strengthen the black group and attack e8.
]
;B[hi]
;W[jh]
;B[ig]
C[Uberdude: It's rather painful to run with slow shape like this, but that's the cost of greedy n2.
]
;W[hc]
C[Uberdude: I wonder if there is a way white can use the j13 weak group to invade at m17 or m16 area.
]
;B[jc]
C[Uberdude: although this feels passive, it makes a lot of points and fixes m17.
]

C[Uberdude: @Celebrir RE b11. That is a big point, but that black group is already alive thanks to b4. There are various ways to use the c14 aji. One is to simply extend at c13, then white d13. If next black c12 white can probably play c11 instead of d12 (if d12 black happily plays c11 to connect and make much more points than b11). Another idea is c17, threatening b15. However, once white defended at f17 I decided I would not be able to live at c17, so sacrificed c14 in order to separate and attack the e8 group, and help my h12 group.

C[Uberdude: In this shape you are usually supposed to atari at b13. If white connects it's a good exchange as it makes b12 gote. b12 would be a big ko. But here I thought white could maybe answer b13 at d12, and when I take squeeze at e13.
]
;W[bh]
C[Uberdude: Even though white gets this which is big for points, it damages d11 so I didn't mind too much.

C[Uberdude: Painful to have to play a move like this.

C[Uberdude: I thought I was lucky white never cut here, so had been hoping to get sente to defend it for ages. But maybe I should play the e3 tesuji: if white e2 then I can cut at d4, if white d4 I e2 in likely sente for d2 and white only has 1 eye in the corner so relies on a spare eye around e7. It would be nice to capture f2 in sente, and then play r8.
]
;W[eq]
C[Uberdude: So white spotted my tesuji there =(
]
C[Uberdude: But I do get sente to start the endgame.

C[Uberdude: Good move, it slowed me down coming into the middle.
]
;B[md]
;W[hb]
;B[no]
C[Uberdude: The meaning of this peep is I want to play p11, but if I do so directly then q10 p10 q9 q8 p8 cut is dangerous. With this exchange I can capture p8 with o8.

C[Uberdude: Defending the p8 cut, whilst reducing middle and building some potential of my own.

C[Uberdude: Something I spend a lot of time reading in this game was the h7 wedge, it almost works for white to cut off and kill h6. That's one reason I played L3 instead of preventing white making points with o12, it helps with a semeai that can develop after h7 j7 g7 j6 j8 k7 l6 m7 k5.

C[Uberdude: Maybe I should play f15 now, and let white play f12 tesuji.

C[Uberdude: @Celebrir, at this point I seem to recall I counted black maybe 6 points ahead, so I gained a few more in yose.
]
C[Uberdude: o15 would be a very big mistake now: due to L7 reinforcement white h7 wedge will now work.
]
C[Uberdude: I presume gomad had spotted it by now, or did I spend all this time worrying for nothing ;-)
