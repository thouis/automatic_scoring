C[Uberdude: I was happy to get a strong group here as it made e5 uncomfortable. But if f16 was a pincer probably I am happy to take the corner as l17 is low and far rather than k16.

C[Uberdude: This felt a bit greedy to me as my cut was powerful, gentler h5 better?

C[Uberdude: Should be o9 net. I was so happy from kill I thought game was already over.

C[Uberdude: With the big kill I counted I could give white the whole top side (instead of fighting there which surely is possible but has some risk) and still win by 20 points so played this simple move.
]
C[Uberdude: But I now think I should play s3 to answer k10: it means I can answer L2 at k9 and white can't live inside and s3 means my corner is safe, whereas in the game if I answer l2 at k9 then to stop white living inside my group also doesn't have 2 eyes and it loses the semeai was my reading.

C[Uberdude: s14 double sente indeed most important place. But it's not an easy win as I might then try the e9 cut. I can think about sacrificing c7 stones as a dead shape, the complication is whether white b4 is sente on my corner or can I ignore and win a semeai? If you had c9 or b4 earlier I wouldn't have that chance.
