;B[bq]
C[paintcan: this game
]
C[paintcan: you're right
]
C[paintcan: its horrendous
]
C[paintcan: i think black win though

C[integer: hmm

C[integer: J3 area or something lame on top

C[integer: how to life

C[integer: can i save J4 probably not
]
C[integer: A4 hurts like my groin is on fire
]
C[integer: A4 A6 seem mutual
]
C[integer: so what the fuck
]
C[integer: fuck this shit
]
;B[rj]
C[paintcan: i think
]
C[paintcan: u can live
]
C[paintcan: no problrm
]
C[paintcan: but i am
]
C[paintcan: looking pretty crispy here
]
C[integer: i'll trade you life for life
]
C[integer: 20 min no rush
]
C[paintcan: thtats a hard trade
]
C[paintcan: to attempt
]
C[paintcan: your group on left
]
C[paintcan: has much ore eye shape
]
C[paintcan: and lots of defects to exploit
]
C[paintcan: on the outside
]
C[paintcan: the right side group
]
C[paintcan: crispy
]
;W[rk]
C[integer: huh
]
C[integer: there is no eye shape, eye shape for one eye
]
C[integer: but A4/A6 seem to kill everything on bottom
]
C[integer: and what are you talking about defects
]
;B[oi]
C[paintcan: mayb e i'm crazy
]
;W[pi]
C[integer: hmm
]
;B[bn]
C[integer: i am taking the gandhi approach, trying to live before trying to kill then
]
C[paintcan: now
]
C[paintcan: i can save b5
]
C[paintcan: but B8 probably lives
]
C[integer: yes that's what i'm wondering
]
C[integer: because it still looks hairy
]
C[paintcan: consdering that
]
C[paintcan: E4
]
C[paintcan: exposes the aji of F3
]
C[paintcan: and makes nearly 2 eyes on its own
]
C[integer: B4/A4 myself are stupid
]
C[paintcan: i think your stones there are well done
]
C[integer: eh what aji
]
C[paintcan: after e4
]
C[paintcan: f3 threatens to use shortage
]
C[paintcan: on E3 and G4
]
C[paintcan: big profitable cut
]
C[paintcan: from J4
]
C[paintcan: anways
]
C[paintcan: im not sure the right side group is dead
]
C[paintcan: but im going to spend a move anyhow
]
;W[ri]
C[paintcan: cause
]
C[paintcan: im a punkass
]
C[integer: ????. From move 97: E19 E4 A4 F3 F2 G3 H3 G2 H2 E2 D2 F1 H1 G1 D1 A2 A3 B1 
]
C[integer: no i didn't play away because i thought it was dead
]
C[integer: i plalyed away because i didn't want to die
]
C[integer: ??? maebe. From move 98: E4 N7 F3 F2 G3 H3 G2 H2 D2 E2 D1 
]
C[integer: this cofuses me
]
;B[iq]
C[integer: but with this better
]
C[paintcan: j3
]
C[paintcan: its Big
]
;W[hq]
C[integer: didn't think of this move
]
C[integer: now again tough spot
]
C[integer: since i'm not sure of life
]
C[paintcan: wont b4
]
C[paintcan: make a life?
]
C[paintcan: or c4
]
C[paintcan: something liek that
]
C[integer: yeah but then my last move was idiotic
]
C[integer: since you capture
]
C[paintcan: if you j2
]
C[paintcan: i mght
]
C[paintcan: activate b5
]
C[paintcan: but i might reply
]
C[integer: yes who knows
]
C[paintcan: j2, h2
]
C[integer: it is a mystery
]
C[paintcan: and blacks shape
]
C[paintcan: is pretty bad there anyway
]
C[paintcan: but k5 shortage and cut at j6after push 
]
C[paintcan: is still in play
]
C[paintcan: so you could say
]
C[paintcan: j2, h2, k4
]
C[paintcan: forcing white to defend J6
]
C[paintcan: and then live
]
C[paintcan: Comfortably
]
C[paintcan: possibly already alive
]
C[integer: wait are you serious
]
C[integer: oh god
]
C[integer: now i feel like a real dumbass
]
C[integer: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
]
;B[in]
C[integer: i think i need to cut first
]
C[integer: to see how you respond
]
C[integer: before i do anything with J3

C[paintcan: yes
]
C[paintcan: E
]
C[paintcan: E4 is the move
]
C[paintcan: i should never
]
C[paintcan: have revealed
]
C[paintcan: the wu tang secret
]
;W[fr]
C[integer: well then i just would have killed right and we'd be back to square mutual destruction
]
C[paintcan: did you have a killing sequence
]
C[paintcan: cirpsy looking group on right
]
C[paintcan: but
]
C[paintcan: i couldnt read a straight kill
]
C[paintcan: otherwise id never have tenukid
]
C[integer: tenukid? you spent S11 tho
]
;B[ap]
C[paintcan: s11 seems prudent
]
C[paintcan: particuarly as ive had some drink
]
C[integer: and no i don't know about killing sequense
]
C[integer: i am not good with seqences
]
C[integer: but i felt it in my grandfather's bones
]
C[integer: that it could be killed
]
C[paintcan: thst good enoguh for me
]
C[integer: and believe you me i would have tried
]
C[integer: oops what is A4 derp
]
C[paintcan: well
]
C[paintcan: the worst is
]
C[paintcan: a loss of yose
]
C[integer: i was trying to save the two stones :(
]
C[paintcan: b4 is probaly bigger than
]
C[paintcan: connecting at a2
]
C[integer: C4?
]
C[paintcan: b4
]
C[integer: black C4 i mean
]
C[integer: what
]
C[integer: err
]
C[integer: WHITE
]
C[integer: white c4 i meant
]
C[integer: here
]
C[integer: that was my derp
]
C[integer: because i missed it
]
C[integer: i need nicotine brb
]
C[paintcan: compter die and i should have leep
]
C[paintcan: sleep
]
C[paintcan: no sleep yet

C[paintcan: i asked younggil to review one of our games, are you interested in seeing it?

C[integer: sure!
]
C[integer: you paid to get it reviewed though? then it's not really fair is it
]
C[paintcan: paid yes, but already done
]
C[paintcan: got an email i can send it to?

C[integer: sure, i have electronic mail
]
C[integer: tristesse@gmail.com
]
;B[ff]
C[paintcan: i sent it
]
;W[cg]
;B[dh]
C[integer: yeah i saw
]
C[integer: reviews always make me acutely aware of my stupid brain's extreme hindsight bias. most stuf just seems like "of course, i knew that, what's the matter with me god"
]
C[integer: one programmer to the next tho how good are you with uhh programming puzzle type things. it's an actual thing i'm trying to solve but it's like a programming puzzle
]
C[integer: i have a n-sided polygon P=\[p0,p1,p2...pn-1\] in the cartesian plane. all the sides of this polygon has lengths in \[1, T) for some given T>1. it is not necessarily convex, but it doesn't self-intersect or anything. now i want to generate another polygon Q=\[q0,q1...\] subject to the same constraints, but surrounds P such that: the distance from any point in P to any point in Q is at least 1, and for each q∈Q there's at least two points in P whose distance is in \[1,T), and vice versa for each point in P.
]
C[integer: or alternatively: i have some polygon/triangulation and i want to "triangulate outwards" from this shape, using only triangles with side lengths in \[1,T)
]
C[integer: and also to discover if this is not possible
]
C[integer: been driving me nuts for half the day, it doesn't seem like it should be v. hard, but i feel old and stupid now. and i hate trig/linear alg
]
C[paintcan: sorry man i'm not geometrically inclined
]
;W[ag]
;B[ah]
C[paintcan: if it's actually for a graphics puzzle, the answer is to take the algorithm from somewhere else
]
C[paintcan: at least for me
]
;W[gf]
;B[hf]
C[integer: not graphics-graphics per se. but well, kinda, has to do with building planar graphs that have some certain symmetry (and so they display nicely in 2d)
]
C[integer: but i forgot to add the most important part also, in that i want all line segments to be as short as possible (either their sum or their square sum -- i can't figure out either anyway)
]
C[integer: and i have tried to google all over the place but i think it's a pretty obscure problem and haven't found anything
]
C[integer: i eventually gave up, but now i have a different problem, with nonaffine transformations..

C[paintcan: all ggs
]
C[integer: you ever been into starcrafts
]
C[paintcan: not really
]
C[paintcan: i was very bad
]
C[integer: always associate gg from there
]
C[paintcan: gg hf etc
]
C[paintcan: starcraft and counterstrike
]
C[integer: oh yes i was terrible too but i watched it ESPORTS REPRESENTS WOO HOO BROSEFTS ESPROT ESPORTS
]
C[integer: and so on
]
C[paintcan: lmao awp noob long a wallhack
]
C[paintcan: i was terrible at counterstrike too bt i wasted lots of years on that
]
C[integer: heh
]
C[paintcan: i watched the esports vids ofo incfredible headshots
]
C[integer: have a friend who pissed away his business education playing cs
]
C[integer: good times
]
C[paintcan: an easy and terrible mistake to make
]
C[integer: ya
]
C[integer: but only fps i ever liked after doom and quake I was instagib mod for quake3
]
C[paintcan: i loved quake3 but solely as a personal challenge
]
C[paintcan: beat game on nightmare
]
C[paintcan: but terrible online
]
C[integer: just the pure bare bones of fps. eye-mouse, mouse-eye, all that should exist. i hate all the "realism" in like modern war simulators whatever. gadgets and different weapons and manoeuvers
]
C[integer: slow huffing human-like movements
]
C[paintcan: well, i loved cs because the game was difficult and dumb
]
C[integer: instagib is the dumbest you can get
]
C[integer: railgun, infinite ammo, one shot kills
]
C[paintcan: the fact that smoke grenades brought most machines to a grinding halt was an integral strategy
]
C[integer: no armor no pickups none of that bullshit
]
C[paintcan: as well as the fact that bullets would pierce many conrers of the game
]
C[paintcan: i used to love picking up an ak and running into a room, shooting bullets at the floor
]
C[paintcan: so that the recoil would bounce all the b ullets into peoples heads
]
C[integer: hehe
]
C[paintcan: i spent way too much time figuring out how to use broken features of the game
]
C[paintcan: to actually learn to play well
]
C[integer: must be similar to button mashing strategy in street fighter
]
C[integer: random bouncing bullets everywhere i mean
]
C[paintcan: well, you can't just shoot and hit people i the game
]
C[paintcan: proper playing is walking everywhere and having laser aim right at the edge of walls
]
C[paintcan: where you know peoples heads will pop out
]
C[paintcan: and listening for footsteps
]
C[integer: lag? fucked hit boxes?
]
C[paintcan: but with some weapons, like the ak
]
C[paintcan: the spray patterns were very particular
]
C[paintcan: so you could use them in apparently retarded ways to great effect
]
C[paintcan: skill involved, but the wrong skill
]
C[integer: it's games, isn't it all the wrong skills
]
C[paintcan: i agree, nothing like quake 3 and a rail gun
]
C[paintcan: just a running camera and a target, no recoil
]
C[paintcan: but i'm bad at both kinds of fps
]
C[paintcan: geez, games are just too hard
]
C[integer: yeah though i have all the respect for people who are able to play quake3 proper and zone out areas and get spawns shit
]
C[integer: but i love super simplicity
]
C[integer: of instagib
]
C[paintcan: cs had similar mod
]
C[integer: almost just one skill dimension
]
C[integer: maybe some dodge stuff
]
C[integer: and hyper fast paced
]
C[paintcan: i just liked how buggy cs was
]
C[integer: good adhd drug
]
C[paintcan: like, if you selected knife and ran diagonally
]
C[paintcan: you'd somehow run faster than any other way
]
C[integer: hahah
]
C[paintcan: same for the scout sniper rifle
]
C[integer: how does that even get programmed
]
C[paintcan: so a lot of the game is being able to move faster than anyone else to get to strategic points
]
C[paintcan: lots of games have the strafe run bug
]
C[paintcan: such as venerable doo
]
C[paintcan: m
]
C[integer: if (player.activeWeapon == WP_KNIFE) speed *= 1.07;
]
C[paintcan: but the 'heaviness' of the weapon you have out
]
C[paintcan: that  is unique to cs i think
]
C[integer: aha
]
C[paintcan: there were 'kz_' maps too
]
C[paintcan: it was a modded form of the game where the only goal
]
C[paintcan: was to climb
]
C[paintcan: ridiculous maps
]
C[paintcan: and you'd have to exercise your skill in using every glitchy cs bug
]
C[paintcan: to make diffierent jumps
]
C[paintcan: no killing each other, just terrorists and counter terrorists
]
C[integer: yeah seen some stuff like that for quake lineage too
]
C[paintcan: jumping up ice sculptures and giant beanstalks and shit
]
C[integer: how wars should be settled
]
C[paintcan: anyways
]
C[paintcan: this was good, we should
]
C[paintcan: do more gos
]
C[paintcan: i may pas this to younggil for my next game review
]
C[integer: how much do you pay
]
C[paintcan: if i do, u want a copy of that one too?
]
C[integer: and have you tried other teachers too
]
C[paintcan: 25 / review
]
C[paintcan: i had dinerchtein do some for me some years ago
]
C[integer: 25 canadian dollars per review? that seems like a lot
]
C[paintcan: imo younggil's got the best review writing, but the depth of the review depends on the game and how he feels
]
C[paintcan: the one he did for our game was a bit shallower than most of his
]
C[paintcan: well, considering that his time is valuable, it would be insulting to pay less i think
]
C[paintcan: i wouldn't want to be taking in that kind of wor kas a professional and charge less
]
C[integer: i've never gotten lessons or had reviews but i have this vague blue sky of once trying to buy like 5-10 lessons from each of the most popular teachers to see what i like
]
C[paintcan: ahh
]
C[paintcan: well, an internet buddy of mine had lessons from younggil for a good while
]
C[paintcan: and i got to sit in a few, since he used games vs me some times
]
C[paintcan: that plus the reviews he does for say, gogameguru.com, is why i asked him
]
C[integer: oh he's the one who does the gogameguru ones?
]
C[paintcan: yep
]
C[integer: cool
]
C[paintcan: i dunno, it's nice to get an authoritative overlook of how game is lose
]
C[paintcan: worth 25 / week for me
]
C[integer: i guess. was thinking of having live game lessons tho, and ask to have them open games here to draw attention to the site. but don't feel i can until they implement some sort of mod controls etc
]
C[paintcan: ahhh
]
C[paintcan: well, that's not a bad idea
]
C[integer: but yeah i have no idea what is common in price. thought maybe for a pro looking over such a lowly game as mine it would be like 10 minutes and at a glance all the horror would be before their eyes. but whatever. since i got a real job i don't know what to use money for to make happy, i've just been buying gadgets books and energy drinks and it's not working
]
C[paintcan: probably quite expensive though
]
C[paintcan: thats orughly my justification
]
C[paintcan: BUy happiness
]
C[paintcan: ~_~
]
C[integer: if only
]
C[integer: my white male privilege should have afforded me something
