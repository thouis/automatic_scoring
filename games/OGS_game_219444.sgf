C[Uberdude: I regretted this joseki choice as your m3 reduces the influence of h3 well. Maybe o3, to abandon r5 for now and build a big lower side (but j4 is an annoying reduction), so either p4 or o4 should be better, e.g. p4 p3 o4 n3 r14 r15 q14 o16 r11 etc. What do you think?

C[Uberdude: With both o17 and c6 low I really didn't know what to do here. This seemed rather boring but I couldn't find anything better.

C[Uberdude: I think this could almost be called the losing move. Black pushes and the influence builds a big left side whilst white's influence is useless due to strong m4 stone. Guo Juan 5p said simply defending at f4 is better, as then when black plays d11 white can still invade at c9 or d9 (though white might just play b16 for now and it's a bit slow for black to spend another move to fix).

C[Uberdude: It's hard to put a point value on a direction mistake like this, but I'd say this is at least a 5 point loss for white.

C[Uberdude: I was angry so cut immediately, simple b16 didn't seem enough to win.

C[Uberdude: It's probably aji keshi, but I thought if I jumped directly then you would get e13 peep which is a nice exchange and I can't invade left so might as well make it stronger. But it does lose me c15.

C[Uberdude: I remember I was happy to get sente here, as then I can at least pretend to make something big on the top side. I was thinking something around j15 might be nice for black, or just take points at c17.

C[Uberdude: I was wondering if I could get the k15 l15 l17 l16 exchange in as that would reduce your eyeshape on the top side in sente, but couldn't find the right time. Maybe now? But I recall thinking black could resist.

C[Uberdude: A little soft? I was somewhat worried about o12 cut but as you're ahead it's a safe move.

C[Uberdude: c15 looks much better than this. I seem to recall I thought giving you d15 atari meant you could cut f14 but I can't see how now. c15 d15 e15 f15 e16 f16 and then e17 d14 miai.

C[Uberdude: I wonder if here I should m7, as I misjudged how much you would get there with the k5 peep. It aims at k9 thinness, but the problem is black can fix that in sente with l8 peep, so I didn't.

C[Uberdude: I thought maybe I should play d14 here as it seems to be sente for c12, and is thus double sente and builds me a point or two in e14 area. But if there is a tenuki battle black coming into the upper right corner might kill it.
]
C[Uberdude: But maybe I should recognise I am behind and take the chance and play d14, hoping you d12 in which case I gain a bit, and then come back to n19.

C[Uberdude: Sharp move, I only spotted it after you had m7 gote, but I couldn't let you m7 in sente.

C[Uberdude: So painful that after spending all those moves on this wall, I still have to play pathetic defensive moves like this rather than connecting.

C[Uberdude: Now that you had k6, I counted this as bigger than p1 which I feared you would tenuki to cut at p5. But again I should recognise I am behind and play p1 and hope you answer it and then p6 to have a chance of winning. But I think at this point I thought I was only 1.5 behind so tried to play the best move rather than the risky I'm behind ones.

C[Uberdude: Lost 2 points here, should have d1. (For observers, the threat is d1, if w c1 then b6 b4 c8 then d8 b6, or b7 d9).
]
;B[ds]
C[Uberdude: Here I thought "Oh no! I could have won by 0.5 if I didn't lose 2 points there". But I had evidently miscounted or else you played a better yose after this.

C[Uberdude: Although this is only 3 points (not 2 as it means I can omit q18 teire) and h1 is 4, this is reverse sente and gives me tedomari, so thought it was correct.
