]
;B[ph]
;W[qc]
C[djeinstine: Wow a lot of people here.
]
;B[nc]
C[djeinstine: Famous people :p
]
C[cook777: I have a friend thats all about studing the opening.
]
C[djeinstine: Cook I think I need to do the same.
]
C[cook777: no idea how many of 1,000s of games he looked at.
]
C[djeinstine: There is a book he can look at.
]
;W[nd]
C[Eizero: I don't really focus on opening
]
C[djeinstine: Its called dictionary of fuseki or something.
]
;B[mc]
C[Eizero: i think at our levels it's not that important
]
C[cook777: and your a 5d? can I quat you? lol
]
C[Eizero: idk what rank I should be in this server I just set it as that
]
C[djeinstine: Lol if Eizero can be 5d with no fuseki studying then there's hope for us all.
]
;W[oc]
C[djeinstine: What is your rank on other servers?
]
C[Eizero: it's just that reading and go problems are more important
]
C[cook777: djeinstine he got know foseki eve if not sutyd it.
]
C[Eizero: 6d on tygem, 6d on kgs (probably should be kgs 5d)
]
C[djeinstine: Wow still...
]
C[djeinstine: cook777 yea I agree. At least direction of play is needed to be high dan.
]
;B[rc]
C[Eizero: i mean I know some opening principles but really everything is based on reading..

C[cook777: I find tesuji problems are harder find then jsut streat up L&D.
]
C[djeinstine: cook777: yes they are.
]
C[Eizero: I mean after a certain point strategy books don't help as much
]
;W[id]
C[Eizero: but go problems if they are hard enough do help
]
;B[jc]

C[djeinstine: Do I read one long chain really well or do I read many small variations really quickly.
