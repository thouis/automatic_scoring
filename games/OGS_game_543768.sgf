C[JeansebL: have fun

C[santiago: thank you

C[santiago: you too!

;B[cp]
C[JeansebL: ohoh i haven't played a crossed fuseki in a long time lol
]
C[santiago: i'm preparing some korean roasted rice green tea to get some inspiration :)
]
C[santiago: ...
]
;W[pp]
C[JeansebL: lol
]
;B[eq]
;W[od]
C[santiago: you didn't give me two corners :(
]
;B[de]
;W[cg]
C[JeansebL: hehe
]
C[JeansebL: you must know Gabriel Benmergui right ?
]
C[santiago: yes, of course
]
C[santiago: did he study with you?
]
C[JeansebL: unfortunately not
]
C[JeansebL: but we talked a lot when he was working on kaya, and kept talking after kaya :p

C[santiago: hmm, i should remember the ladder before playing this...
]
C[dfunkt: I never thought I'd hear the words "after Kaya" but it happened.  Too bad.
]
C[filosofen: Yeah, what happened with Kaya? 
]
C[dfunkt: the devs ran out of steam
]
C[filosofen: I think the new OGS is a lot like what kaya wanted to be
]
C[dfunkt: only better
]
C[filosofen: :)
]
;B[ch]
C[filosofen: Has anyone heard anything about the big update coming this week?
]
C[dfunkt: I've heard about it for 2 months
]
C[filosofen: haha ok
]
;W[dh]
;B[dg]
C[filosofen: I saw one of the devs saying in the forum that it is going public beta in a few days
]
;W[bh]
C[dfunkt: yeah, they say that every few days.  I bet it'll be worth the wait though
]
;B[eb]
C[dfunkt: the way black is playing feels like the way I play

C[filosofen: I think white is happy with this result
]
;W[hb]
;B[cf]
;W[ci]
;B[bb]
C[dfunkt: it's always a local victory if you can settle 2 groups while your opponent settles one
]

C[dfunkt: and end with sente

C[RobertT: I'm surprised white didn't try to punish e13
]
;W[ph]
C[RobertT: it's a ladder dependent move when white had the ladder...
]
;B[qh]
C[RobertT: the ladder. From move 13: D13 E12 D11 E18 D18 E17 E16 D16 F17 F16 E15 F15 E14 D14 F14 G14 F13 
]
C[RobertT: if he doesn't have the ladder, he has to play under. From move 13: D13 E12 D11 E18 D18 E17 E16 D16 E19 F16 F18 E15 K17 
]
;W[qi]
C[JeansebL: interesting we have proably more observers here than we would have on kgs :p
]
C[RobertT: when black doesn't have the ladder, this move is usually the choice. From move 12: D13 
]
C[dfunkt: that's because on kgs the time setting would probably be 5 mix 3x10
]
C[dfunkt: min*
]
;B[pi]
;W[qj]
;B[oi]
C[filosofen: Thanks for sharing the variations, RobertT! 
]
C[dfunkt: yes.  I may not remember that ladder, but it's good to see it just in case
]
;W[ok]
;B[mi]
;W[mk]
;B[ki]
C[filosofen: The variation sharing function is a really nice feature 
]
C[dfunkt: it's the most awesome thing.  Kaya had it and OGS has it, but when I go on KGS I feel crippled
]
;W[nh]
;B[ni]
C[RobertT: black has nothing here
]
C[RobertT: w can just tenuki to bottom if he wants
]
;W[jp]
;B[lc]
C[dfunkt: but white needed o12 or black could have cut off the q13 stones, right?
]
;W[ld]
C[RobertT: o12 makes it easier since it doesnt depend on the k14 area but I don't think it was needed to protect the cut yet
]
C[JeansebL: A good timing to use this :)
]
C[JeansebL: I feel like I'm a bit ahead right now... but the game is just beginning...
]
;B[nb]
C[RobertT: there's some possibility of a counter attack without that protect move but blacks center gets hurt too. From move 51: K4 Q15 P15 P14 P13 O14 O13 N14 N13 M14 M13 L14 L13 K14 K13 M17 
]
C[RobertT: so its a good exchange
]
;W[mc]
;B[mb]
;W[kc]
C[RobertT: now it just dies. From move 54: Q15 P15 P14 O14 P13 P12 
]
;B[lb]
C[RobertT: and this cut is no better. From move 54: P15 Q15 Q16 O16 O14 N14 O13 O15 
]
C[Pempu: M18 is way too small
]
C[Pempu: crawling on the second line at this stage
]
C[Pempu: J11 for fun L9 for profit
]
C[RobertT: depends if the l16 cut  is severe enough
]
C[Pempu: both white groups are difficult to kill
]
;W[kg]
C[dfunkt: it seems white is taking no chances
]
C[Pempu: playing it smart :)
]
C[dfunkt: nice and safe
]
C[Kungfu Panda: a little boring.... a little
]
C[JeansebL: felt like protecting the cut right away was too slow, this feels like a good compromise...
]
;B[qq]
;W[pq]
C[Pempu: uhm leaving L11 under attack is a big risk
]
C[filosofen: w will profit a lot chasing L11
]
C[dfunkt: but l11 will be hard to kill 
]
C[Pempu: true
]
C[filosofen: It does not have to be killed
]
C[RobertT: there is still some weakness  around q10
]
C[Pempu: I would have blocked at R4
]
;B[qp]
C[Kungfu Panda: R6 now
]
;W[qo]
;B[ro]
C[trohde: How come JeansebL is so low on time already? (I came late)
]
C[dfunkt: he's a thinker
]
C[JeansebL: I count I'm ahead by about the komi right now + he has a weak group, so with no silly mistakes, I should be fine
]
;W[qn]
C[trohde: :-D OK
]
C[trohde: thx
]
C[JeansebL: L9 and G3 and among my targets
]
;B[rn]
;W[qm]
;B[pr]
;W[or]
;B[qr]
C[Pempu: seems like a succesfull 3-3 invasion by black
]
C[dfunkt: why di=oes white think so long about this basic joseki?  is there something I am missing?
]
C[Kungfu Panda: maybe tried to get sente
]
;W[kk]
C[JeansebL: I guess I'll need to stop malkovich soon if I don't want to lose on time lol
]
C[JeansebL: I never remember if there's a ''0'' byo yomi or not :p
]
C[santiago: hmm, i think you can spend one more byoyomi
]
C[santiago: but don't take my word for it :)
]
C[JeansebL: hehe :p
]
C[santiago: i remember gabriel was mad once because he lost because of the byoyomi
]
C[Pempu: too bad they use byo-yomi and not fischer time
]
C[Kungfu Panda: thats why i prefered R6 over R5
]
C[Pempu: cut potential. From move 74: K12 M11 M12 M10 L12 N12 
]
C[dfunkt: oh, there's the answer to the time question trohde
]
C[RobertT: would have to be absolutely sure you can kill . From move 74: K12 M11 M10 M12 N10 L10 M9 
]
C[Pempu: bleh. From move 74: L12 K13 J11 J9 H12 C6 H3 K2 
]
C[Pempu: yeah takes time to learn OGS way of telling byo-yomi periods
]
C[Pempu: I can't say what is better. Just used to KGS system
]
C[RobertT: I never go into byo yomi so I have no idea how it works
]
C[Pempu: I prefer fischer though
]
C[RobertT: (on OGS)
]
C[Franzisa: Good evening
]
;B[ii]
C[filosofen: Evening, franzisa

;W[ik]
C[santiago: i think it was in a wagc and he had 1/30 on the clock :)

;B[os]
;W[hg]
;B[gi]
;W[fh]

;B[gk]
C[Pempu: huge ko. From move 85: N2 P3 P4 N3 P2 
]
;W[ji]
C[JeansebL: sorry, it's mean to play a move like that in byo yomi :p
]
C[RobertT: bad ko for white
]
C[Pempu: yeah
]
;B[pk]
C[RobertT: if white loses then his entire center is gone. if white wins then he gains about 6 points more than if he just solid connected
]
;W[pj]
C[RobertT: probably just extend locally. From move 85: N3 
]
;B[jj]
C[pasuking: yeah i disagree with this fight as well, 
]
;W[jh]
;B[ij]
;W[kj]
;B[jk]
C[Pempu: no go. From move 90: P10 P8 R9 S9 S10 S11 S8 T10 R8 S7 T7 Q8 T8 T9 T6 S4

;W[em]
;B[ek]
;W[cm]
;B[eh]
C[dfunkt: white looks a little thin around g13 to play this way
]
C[RobertT: if this doesnt die then h7 was a mistake. the profit on the left isnt enough when losing the entire center
]
;W[ei]
;B[fi]
C[Pempu: W wins easily
]
;W[gg]
;B[ej]
;W[di]
;B[ih]
C[RobertT: well b is alive
]
;W[ig]
C[RobertT: assuming he doesnt kill himself
]
;B[dl]
C[santiago: ok now i'm in the last byoyomi
]
C[Pempu: B6 hurts corner
]

C[RobertT: d8 doesnt do annything
]
;B[gm]

C[RobertT: its still gote life

C[Pempu: ko. From move 125: C2 C3 E2 D2 D1 D3 F2 B2 B1 
]
;W[kp]

C[Pempu: white steals corner. From move 127: C2 C3 E2 B2 D3 D4 D2 B1

C[RobertT: d1. From move 125: C2 D3 
]
;W[hp]
;B[dm]
;W[dp]

C[Pempu: D4 is really bad endgame
]
;B[bp]
C[RobertT: I guess this endgame. From move 125: C2 D3 B4 B3 B5 B2 
]
;W[bo]
C[Pempu: yeah or directly B4
]
;B[ao]
;W[an]
;B[ap]
;W[cn]
C[RobertT: iirc this move is possible when e4 cut is a danger. From move 125: D3 
]
;B[jb]
C[RobertT: something like this. From move 125: D3 D4 C3 E2 B4 B5 B3 C6 D2 F4 B1 
]
;W[jc]

C[dfunkt: t10 ko threat is why white should have solidly connected earlier
]
;B[bf]
C[RobertT: it was more than just a ko threat. it forced white to defend with t7 when it wasn't the biggest area
]
C[dfunkt: ahh, ok
]
;W[ha]
C[RobertT: also t10 is the wrong ko threat. he should s11 first to make another ko threat
]

C[RobertT: t10 removed 1 ko threat
]
;W[]
C[dfunkt: so may endgame things to learn
]
;B[ns]
C[dfunkt: many*
]
C[RobertT: the reason white played t11 to begin with is beccause he though he had a ko follow up because of s15 weakness
