C[Uberdude: In the 2 games in my database (both from 2009) with this shape, white cut at q8 and captured p3 stones in exchange for black munching r10 and got sente.

C[Uberdude: An annoying reduction, but f5 at j4 seemed too slack.

C[Uberdude: Dubious? I was trying to find a way to use my wall, but missed the j7 cut after g4 h6 combo. Maybe better to just d7 and allow white to jump again as it's still weak.

C[Uberdude: The trade seemed like a bit of a compromise, but at least I got a decent corner and sente. k8 doesn't look so stupid either.

C[Uberdude: I'll be using this game as an example of approaching a corner in the shadow of thickness at a study session with Guo Juan 5p this weekend.

C[Uberdude: I expected e10 as it was double sente, but I suppose you wanted to keep the f12 peep aji.

C[Uberdude: j15 seemed too obedient, and defending against 3-3 is huge. I tend to play r13 at r14 these days.

C[Uberdude: Was a bit sad to sacrifice as I could possibly have defended  the cut in sente for k3 (thought that loses yose), but at least this jump sacrificed in better shape than k9.

C[Uberdude: Too early, as your next move here is same 1 net gote as white r1 before black s2, but that makes my s2 a 4 point gain in sente. p5 is something like 4 points in sente.
