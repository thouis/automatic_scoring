C[Mikasa: B9 was very greedy for white and C13 was played WAY to fast
]
C[Mikasa: Letting me have C3 was really painful for white
]
C[Mikasa: He probably thought I would respond to C13
]
C[Mikasa: C17 is a bit random >.<
]
C[Mikasa: I also want to say I never liked the joseki in the upper right corner...
]
;B[cd]
;W[db]
C[Mikasa: This stone is probably only an aji stone but I think it is more aji-keshi
]
;B[cb]

;W[di]
C[Mikasa: This move should be at D12
]
C[Mikasa: Black can still play C12 to escape 
]
;B[ed]
C[Mikasa: I will make myself stronger at the top though first
]
C[Mikasa: I aslo want to play on the bottom at like J3

C[Mikasa: White has way too many weaknesses right now

C[Mikasa: Black can play N18 O18 N19 
]
;B[ee]
;W[hd]
C[Mikasa: I do not want to give him good shape here some people don't realize how big shape moves like E15 can be
]
;B[gc]
C[Mikasa: He probably still does not realize black can N18
]

C[Mikasa: This is not going to end well for white xD
]
;B[mb]
;W[nb]

;W[ge]
C[Mikasa: Actually tihs was probably wrong timing
]
C[Mikasa: I was hoping he would play Q18 but he did not need to xD
]
;B[pb]
;W[pc]
;B[od]
C[Mikasa: He will probably ignore those 4 stones for now :(
]
;W[qb]
C[Mikasa: Oh? this is bad because L18 is dead which means G17 is alive and now I can attack the F16 and D11
]
C[Mikasa: These are both weak groups now how should I attack it hmmm...
]
;B[eg]
C[Mikasa: I guess this is the best way to cut it
]
;W[je]
C[Mikasa: Sorry, went to get something to drink :D!
]
;B[kf]
;W[jf]
C[Mikasa: I am still not sure how I want to attack the D9 group it seems he is more focused on his top group
]
;B[kg]
;W[ih]
C[Mikasa: Another tip is to "never let your opponent hane on the head of 2 or 3 stones"
]
;B[iq]
C[Mikasa: I am gonna attack the bottom stones first to build some strength around the D9 group
]
;W[fo]

C[Mikasa: Most of the way he is playing is in hope while running atm xD
]
;W[gb]
C[Marnoris: ji
]
C[Mikasa: HMM not sure if I want to respond to this
]
C[Mikasa: If I tenuki he will play H18 J17 J16
]
C[Mikasa: If I respond at H18 what will he play?
]
C[Mikasa: Because I really want to play H15 but.... won't work right now
]
;B[jg]
C[Mikasa: Ewww this was a bad move -_-
]
C[Mikasa: He can H14 now
]
;W[hf]
C[Mikasa: I wonder if I can use this though to strenghn somehow

C[Mikasa: Hmm maybe I can't kill it

]
;B[hb]
C[crodgers: LeandrosSilva, if you click the little book icon next to the viewer count, you can see Mikasa's views on teh game too
