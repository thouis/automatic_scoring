;B[ce]
C[integer: hahaha
]
C[integer: yeah no kidding
]
;W[po]
C[integer: what were you here for?
]
C[paintcan: pleasure trip, only stayed a couple of days
]
C[paintcan: stayed in a capsule hotel, and fortunately there was an all american crap tv channel because between the prices and the jet lag that was about all that could be managed
]
C[paintcan: beautiful city though
]
;B[eq]
;W[cp]
C[integer: i don't find it particularly beautiful, but..
]
C[integer: trondheim is beautiful
]
C[integer: bergen is nice too, everything is in walking distance, and surrounded by mountains and a fjord
]
C[integer: hit me up next time you're here i have teh drugs
]
C[integer: or if you went to bygdøy, that's nice
]
C[integer: rich area
]
C[integer: used to live on top of a garage there
]
C[integer: little island in the oslofjord
]
C[integer: lots of museums and crap
]
C[integer: take a ferry over
]
C[integer: but very nice
]
C[integer: used to go down and sit on the pier at night, reading
]
C[paintcan: sadly oslo was an afterthough in the itinerary (primarily consisting of reykjavik and paris)
]
C[paintcan: very poorly conceived considering the cost
]
C[paintcan: next time i visit norway, i will make sure i visit the prettier places
]
C[paintcan: we were going to visit over there, but weather and foul tempers defeated the plan
]
;B[iq]

C[integer: daw
]
;B[nc]
C[paintcan: you and your tricky styles
]
;W[oq]
C[integer: tricky?
]
C[integer: it's starting to look like a H2 already
]
C[integer: if only E3 was at D4
]
C[paintcan: as in, i can't open up a book or review what other players would do
]
C[integer: hehe
]
C[integer: why would you! we're creating something new and beautiful together~
]
C[integer: i will show the world my art moves
]
C[paintcan: i prefer to create something terrible and boring until the other player gets confused and dies
]
C[paintcan: but this time, i will get confused and die..
]
C[integer: indeed the plan

C[paintcan: wil he play the rapyuta move
]
C[paintcan: this is it. the rapyuta joseki
]
C[integer: what is the rapyuta move
]
C[integer: or joseki
]
C[paintcan: do you remember rapyuta
]
C[integer: yes!!!1
]
C[integer: rapyuta is my hero
]
C[paintcan: rapyuta played R12 all the time
]
C[paintcan: only with Q10 of course
]
C[paintcan: poor dans
]
C[integer: man, where did rapyuta go

C[paintcan: now i need to think - aka ignore the problem every time i see it for the next few days until i impulsively play some junk
]
C[integer: hehe
]
C[integer: sure
]
C[paintcan: E5 is junk and D10 leaves the bottom too loose
]
C[paintcan: and M4 is trash without preparation
]
C[paintcan: what a bunch of baloney
]
C[integer: tenuki~
]
C[paintcan: my favorite part of the game
]
C[integer: when in doubt, take big endgame
]
C[integer: D17 big endgame
]
C[paintcan: D17 or D10 bigger endgame?
]
C[paintcan: so many brain damaged ways to protect the bottom
]
C[paintcan: there must be something clever here
]
C[integer: i don't really know
]
C[integer: i probably just would have played uhh
]
C[integer: no i don't know what i would have played
]
C[integer: i wouldn't have played anything there probably
]
C[integer: cause i don't see anything either
]
C[integer: that is as you say clever
]
C[integer: N3? :p
]
C[integer: surely you must be able to do some shit in my corner too
]
C[paintcan: imo there's lovely aji in the corner but it's a matter of chance who will get to taste it first

C[integer: the part part about corr is there's much more endgame
]
C[integer: not so many things die
]
C[integer: so either i have to learn to play endgame or i have to learn to count endgame so i can resign earlier
]
C[integer: either option is not very appetizing

C[integer: well it was both a merge and a fix
]
C[integer: a merge of a fix
]
C[integer: a billion commits squashed with sundry and comment a la "merge of various fixes one of which should fix this hls live issue"
]
C[integer: if it werent for the fact that this delivery people are polish and don't give a this about anything, id be hated forever
]
;W[qd]
C[paintcan: hls live eh
]
C[paintcan: you are also in the video streaming software business
]
;B[sd]
C[paintcan: i munge hls playlists and transport streams for a living
]
C[integer: ha
]
C[integer: really
]
C[integer: what company
]
C[integer: not video streaming business per se
]
C[integer: i work for opera that web browser that no one uses
]
C[integer: but i do adaptive video stuff on tv side
]
;W[pe]
C[paintcan: ahh opera
]
C[paintcan: i work for a tilny outfit called mDialog (caps and all)
]
C[paintcan: its a strange space
]
;B[pc]
C[integer: never heard of
]
C[integer: but see they're a member of dash INDUSTRY FORUM
]
C[integer: but hls is like the worst adaptive format in existence
]
;W[se]
C[paintcan: i don't know if that's true or not
]
C[paintcan: hls is dead simple
]
C[paintcan: transport streams are gay and terrible
]
;B[sc]
;W[rf]
C[paintcan: the industry is nothing but shitty legacy broadcasting standards
]
C[paintcan: packaged into formats that are varyingly difficult to parse and render sensibly
]
C[integer: it's super simple yes but apple's spec is the gayest on earth and basically allow you to do all sorts of insane stupid things
]
C[integer: which of course some people are stupid enough to do
]
C[integer: and you have to support
]
C[paintcan: apples spec is pretty simple
]
C[paintcan: haha
]
C[paintcan: if you actualy support all that
]
C[paintcan: shit
]
C[paintcan: you're a sucker
]
C[paintcan: the only people who support hls completely are (1) aple
]
C[paintcan: APple
]
C[paintcan: mDialog is paying 3rd party dudes for their Hls implementing chops
]
C[integer: like simply switching number of tracks or codec parameters or fucking format from one segment to the next willy nilly, switching everything
]
C[integer: yeah the specs are just there for show really
]
C[paintcan: #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY bitch
]
C[integer: what apple does is the "true" spec
]
C[paintcan: the mpeg2 spec
]
C[paintcan: covers what is legitimate between segments
]
C[paintcan: you're supposed to DISCONTINUE that shit
]
C[paintcan: if you fuck things p
]
C[paintcan: up
]
C[paintcan: believ em
]
C[paintcan: maybe opera supoprts all that shit
]
C[integer: no we support what is sane
]
C[paintcan: but most players deifnitely barf when they get segments even a little different
]
C[paintcan: apple has the only really good implementation
]
C[paintcan: (ive still made their ios software crash with some rough segments)
]
C[integer: but since we make a player and we're not on the server side we still get insane people with totally fucking insane streams
]
C[integer: that complain
]
C[paintcan: oh yeah that shit will happen
]
C[paintcan: id love to try my streams out
]
C[paintcan: on your shit
]
C[paintcan: especially if i can run it on linux
]
C[paintcan: cause ffmpeg's hls implementation is terrible
]
C[integer: well me and this other guy wrote the "adaptive streaming impl" stuff
]
C[paintcan: i write segment splicing software so we can put ads in
]
C[integer: dash + smooth + hls library basically
]
C[paintcan: and i need an ios device to test it
]
C[integer: i did most of dash and smooth, other guy did most of hls
]
C[integer: we download and de/remux everything
]
C[paintcan: thats some cool sjit
]
C[integer: out
]
C[paintcan: shiT
]
C[integer: so it's seamless whatever is playing for the customer/opera
]
C[integer: doesn't need to know what shitty adaptive format it is in
]
C[paintcan: an Abtstraction Layer
]
C[integer: i like dash, but it's way too all-encompassing. mpeg group are so fucking terrified of leaving out any possibility. that's why other guy likes smooth
]
C[paintcan: mpeg specs fuck man
]
C[integer: but i don't like smooth's use of ms-only mp4 boxes and shit. and i like init segments
]
C[paintcan: you need some proprietary ass software to stream aynthing thats not hls
]
C[paintcan: i mean, hls streams migth be broken, but they're esay
]
C[integer: yes they're easy, but ts is gay forever
]
C[paintcan: half fo all my development effort
]
C[paintcan: has been writing ts unpacking and repacking code
]
C[integer: proprietary as fuck sure but i think i'm lost in that battle
]
C[paintcan: over past year
]
C[integer: i've also done a lot of drm work :p
]
C[paintcan: hls has some
]
C[paintcan: stupid ass drm in its spec
]
C[integer: i am part of the problem
]
C[paintcan: i may have to implement SAMPLE-AES soon
]
C[integer: i am some low levle techie working on the atomic bomb
]
C[integer: minding his own business
]
C[paintcan: itsjust fucking sutpid
]
C[paintcan: the drm does nothing, at least with hls
]
C[integer: while children are playing in kindergartens in hiroshima
]
C[paintcan: it just makes the ppl signing the checks
]
C[integer: hahaha
]
C[paintcan: letting those streams play
]
C[paintcan: think they ass is covered
]
C[integer: well
]
C[paintcan: talkin to the share holders
]
C[paintcan: YEAH its COPT PROTECTED
]
C[integer: there's the "key file" drm
]
C[paintcan: lol
]
C[integer: which is totally stupid yes
]
C[integer: here download this key for the aes key lol
]
C[paintcan: oh its better
]
C[integer: then there's some dudes who will remain nameless
]
C[paintcan: the key is on AKAMAI EDGE AUTH SECURE HD
]
C[paintcan: theres TOKENS and shit\]
]
C[paintcan: tokens => => secure
]
C[integer: who have created some super proprietary locked shit that is basically just a wrapper around the key file system. you give them the url, they download and do super secret shit with it, then you get the key out
]
C[paintcan: Properiertayry HTTP rest api
]
C[integer: and tey charge like tens of thousands of dollars just for the sdk

C[integer: i know
]
C[paintcan: not guys implementing video specs

C[integer: that's what kills my soul

C[paintcan: sheit

C[paintcan: typical

C[paintcan: sales are what

C[paintcan: fuel the fires of idnustry

C[paintcan: thats some bleak grey shit
]
C[paintcan: use scala and c at work
]
C[paintcan: wish it was clojure or haskell and ats
]
C[integer: hey reading is good
]
C[integer: reading means not all is lost
]
C[integer: cause i like reading
]
C[integer: do you read books of literature friend
]
C[integer: but you get to use scala
]
C[integer: that makes me jelly
]
C[integer: C though, ehh
]
C[integer: at least i get C++. though before, before this whole corporate super change of opera at large, we were using some major gimped C++ because of totally obscure legacy bulgarian phone compilers that didn't like "controversial" and "advanced" shit like exceptions for example
]
C[integer: i wish i could use haskell too
]
C[integer: do most of my personal stuff in haskell these days
]
C[integer: except stuff to javascript because haste doesn't compile a lot of stuff i tend to use, and ghcjs produces like 4MB .js files
]
;W[no]
C[paintcan: i have only read haskell, ive never written any
]
C[paintcan: and yeah, i hear u on the reading
]
C[paintcan: one true pleasure
]
;B[nn]
C[paintcan: scala is the c++ of the jvm
]
C[paintcan: theres a lot i like about it but many aspects are nightmare
]
C[paintcan: i like C, but it may have been smartre to write what i work on in C++
]
;W[go]
C[integer: i used to like C. it was the first real language i learnt
]
C[integer: i started weird, like visual basic 1.0/2.0 ---super hard transition--> C -> assembly
]
C[integer: and then worked my way back up through perl, python, and c++
]
C[integer: but now haskell is the king of kings
]
C[integer: and what books do you read
]
C[paintcan: ive got a copy of real world haskell and pearls of functional programming
]
C[paintcan: got some ML books too, which is another read only language for me
]
C[paintcan: purely functional data structures got me started down the path 3 or so years ago
]
C[paintcan: i started with gwbasic, qbasic -> "C++", ye olde x86, then C proper
]
C[paintcan: i really, really fuckign hate
]
C[paintcan: Objects
]
C[paintcan: and _Unit Tests_
]
;B[gp]
C[paintcan: but i recon that programming w/ stl and such similar templated magic might make C++ worth using
]
;W[gm]
C[integer: yeah c++ is super painful without STL (which was another thing they couldn't use before btw, like exceptions, because of like, nepal and bulgaria)
]
C[integer: and i'd say it's pretty painful without boost either
]
C[paintcan: boost, a meta template liborary that takes a full day to compile
]
C[paintcan: providing the marvelous capabilities built into lagnaugges many yeras older than C++
]
C[paintcan: and many years nwere
]
C[paintcan: gigabytes of compiled shared object
]
C[integer: yes, i didn't say c++ was less painful than python or haskell ofc
]
C[integer: but no you don't get that
]
C[paintcan: i got it
]
C[integer: i use a lot of boost in one module
]
C[paintcan: im still going to take the boost jab
]
C[integer: that i did a full rewrite on
]
C[integer: before didn't use any boost
]
C[integer: compile down went down
]
C[integer: predictably
]
C[integer: like 2x as long
]
C[integer: object size didn't go up that i noticed
]
C[paintcan: i only write trivial programs that compile in 2 seconds
]
C[paintcan: haha
]
C[paintcan: compiling boost itself, from sources
]
C[integer: there's no compile in boost
]
C[integer: i don't use anything that requires boost libs
]
C[paintcan: lol
]
C[integer: just boost headers
]
C[paintcan: ahh
]
C[paintcan: i watched someone do it a few years ago
]
C[paintcan: for a project
]
C[integer: didn't want to add the dependency
]
C[paintcan: it literally took all night
]
C[paintcan: he was sitting waiting for it to meet a deadline
]
C[paintcan: the good stuff
]
;B[il]
C[integer: "sonny, in my days, you put the kernel on to compile over night, then you went to school, and you kept going to school, and come easter after all that snow and ice, you had a fresh kernel image"

C[paintcan: it was a monster quadcore computer in the school's graphics lab

C[paintcan: that was the best part
]
C[paintcan: boost brougt that bitch to its knees
]
C[paintcan: thru the magic of C++
]
C[integer: the stuff i use from boost is mostly just niceties, amenities, like signals/slots and function binding for more functional programming
]
C[integer: the latter is in C++11 but can't use that
]
C[paintcan: haha
]
C[paintcan: ive used a bunch of C99 features in my code
]
C[paintcan: and ive actually had platform portability issues
]
C[paintcan: with older vresions of gcc
]
C[paintcan: apparently tons of c99 shit wasnt fully baked in til 2010 or so
]
;B[aj]
C[integer: back when i was asbergers i hung out in #c and virtually knew c89 by heart. all kinds of obscure shit. like why return (printf(".."), NULL) gives a warning on some platforms but others not
]
C[integer: back then i also only had a pentium
]
C[integer: that the government took away
]
C[paintcan: government seized your 586
]
C[integer: and i got a 50mhz 486 from a friend as backup after
]
C[integer: yeah me and my friends were scriptkiddying
]
C[integer: around
]
C[paintcan: damn
]
C[integer: and there was some lawsuit, i didn't get fined
]
C[paintcan: a genuine hacker
]
C[integer: but they kept my computer
]
C[integer: and fucking destroyed it
]
C[integer: because it was evidence and used in a crime
]
C[paintcan: lo
]
C[integer: so fucking retarded
]
C[paintcan: i dont think
]
C[paintcan: evidence is supposed to get destroyed
]
C[integer: and i lost all my old projects and all my childhood shit
]
C[integer: i don't even know, they told me it would be destroyed
]
C[integer: and i wouldn't get it back
]
C[paintcan: the pricks
]
C[integer: the only thing they found on me was a passwd with hundreds of passwords decrypted
]
C[integer: as i'd zipped everything else up good and clean
]
C[integer: and they were not able to crack password encrypted zip files apparently
]
C[integer: but i forgot that damn file
]
C[integer: had written my own icmp scanner to ping all the world's broadcast addresses to find networks that could be used for smurfing
]
C[integer: to throw people i knew from school off the internet
]
C[paintcan: lol
]
;W[cm]
;B[al]
;W[am]
C[integer: though in a way it was good
]
C[integer: the 50mhz was just all console
]
C[integer: and had nothing
]
C[integer: no internet (coudn't use ISDN card)
]
C[integer: so all i could do was program
]
C[paintcan: i went thru a ton of cmoputers
]
C[paintcan: my first was my grandfathers old machine
]
C[integer: and listen to my dad's alanis morissette cd
]
C[integer: and my friend's prodigy cd
]
C[paintcan: amber monitor and two 5 1/4 floppy drives
]
;B[sp]
;W[sq]
C[integer: i did have a 386 before this
]
C[paintcan: nothing to do on that but read the IBM 3 ring binders
]
C[paintcan: which include GWBASIC reference
]
C[integer: that i played xenon and hot rod racing or whatever it was called on
]
;B[so]
C[paintcan: wacky wheels maybe
]
C[integer: no you do drag racing and shit, then do work on your car
]
C[integer: buy better engines
]
C[integer: and shit
]
C[paintcan: lots of driving games, dont think iplayed that one though
]
;W[jp]
;B[ip]
;W[ng]
C[integer: maybe popular only locally
]
;B[ph]
C[integer: since sneakerware back then
]
;W[pg]
C[integer: didn't do any programming back then
]
C[paintcan: i got my hands on a c64 manual
]
C[paintcan: before i got any computer
]
C[integer: yessssssssss
]
C[paintcan: and i learned c64 basic from it
]
C[integer: http://ak0.okccdn.com/php/load_okc_image.php/images/150x150/558x800/350x58/606x314/0/5574001147775162938.jpeg
]
C[integer: check it yo
]
C[paintcan: then i begged my parents for one, and got grandads
]
C[paintcan: nice
]
C[paintcan: the one i got after was a 386 too, moms old one
]
C[paintcan: i used the model m that came with that for years
]
C[integer: the white tennis socks, the lassie poster in the corner, ms word art print out of "IT" because i didn't have a poster for that movie
]
;B[id]
C[integer: oh i had a c64 too
]
C[integer: but again just for games
]
C[paintcan: lucky fellow
]
C[integer: stunts
]
;W[jc]
C[paintcan: teh c64, from what i knew
]
C[integer: well, white and norwegian maybe
]
C[integer: but i was the ghetto kid of my peers, as they had like amigas and shit
]
C[integer: and always better computers
]
C[paintcan: was way better than the crappy 8088 i had
]
C[paintcan: you could peek and poke colors and sounds
]
C[integer: and we were late with getting the internet because my parents insisted we got ISDN first so i wouldn't disconnect them
]
C[paintcan: sure sa shit couldnt do tht
]
C[paintcan: lets see
]
C[integer: yeah there were something like that
]
C[paintcan: i didnt get internet in my home til
]
C[integer: i remember typing some in
]
C[paintcan: 1999
]
C[paintcan: 56k
]
C[integer: to "hack" gamez
]
C[integer: but just typed in from instructions
]
C[integer: had no idea what it meant
]
C[paintcan: that's a legit way to learn i think
]
C[integer: also had 16-color porn images stored on some cassettes
]
C[paintcan: i didn't become sentient as a programmer til i'd been doing it for 6 or so years
]
C[paintcan: maybe more
]
C[paintcan: maybe not yet, i dunno
]
C[integer: and pissed off my dad all the time because i kept taping over his alice cooper cassettes and shit for more and more games
]
C[paintcan: lol
]
C[integer: i have recently gotten into heavy type theory stuff so i'm set back and realize i'm not sentient
]
;B[bc]
C[paintcan: well, my feeling about that is
]
;W[hg]
C[paintcan: it's too difficult right now
]
;B[jh]
;W[ih]
C[paintcan: in a world where
]
C[paintcan: unit tests are written
]
C[integer: homotopy type theory is the new hot shit in math right now, like topology was before
]
C[paintcan: how can you have a type
]
C[integer: that is my current 10 year goal
]
C[integer: to get homotopy type theory in a practical sense maybe
]
C[paintcan: thats a noble goal
]
C[paintcan: i got the book but have not even cracked it open
]
C[integer: here's to dreaming
]
C[paintcan: i haev an introduction to category theory for retards to read first
]
C[paintcan: i did a couple of chapters of that at least
]
C[integer: i get basic category theory, but have no experience in topology/homology/all that shit.
]
C[paintcan: a year+ ago
]
C[paintcan: lol
]
;B[ga]
;W[ha]
;B[fa]
;W[fl]
C[integer: that was a dumb move
]
;B[ep]
;W[dp]
;B[pq]
;W[pr]
;B[js]
C[integer: my friend is a topologist though
]
C[integer: currently doing post doc at MIT

C[integer: this is japanese rules?
]
C[paintcan: let me check
]
C[paintcan: yes
]
;W[ak]
;B[re]
C[integer: ok, couldn't remember if i took yours or you took mine
]
;W[qe]
;B[al]
C[integer: ehh
]
C[integer: way more threats
]
;W[hc]
;B[ak]
;W[]
C[paintcan: w+
]
C[paintcan: maybe komi
]
C[paintcan: i think i caught up a little right at the end
]
C[integer: 11 and 15 i got from the SE
]
;B[]
C[paintcan: my sense is off then
]
C[integer: woah
]
C[integer: haha
]
C[paintcan: i think you lost it
]
C[paintcan: in the last 30 or so moves
]
C[integer: yeah corr games suck because they go to endgame so often
]
C[integer: and my endgame is an absolute sin against man
]
C[integer: you don't need endgame in blitz
]
C[paintcan: i think you did ok in endgame
]
C[paintcan: considering that bubble around L9
]
C[paintcan: just the very last bits
]
C[paintcan: missed out on
]
C[paintcan: F19 too
]
C[integer: yeh
]
C[integer: like lose half a point every round of moves
]
C[integer: adds up
]
C[paintcan: i think properly speaking
]
C[paintcan: you won by a little over komi
]
C[paintcan: well
]
C[integer: properly speaking my weakness is my weakness
]
C[paintcan: i can't possibly rob the other game
]
C[paintcan: from you
]
C[paintcan: with Big territory
]
C[integer: we'll see
]
C[paintcan: but i'm going to try, i'm afraid
]
C[integer: no other way
]
C[paintcan: gg
]
C[integer: i should do some work
]
C[paintcan: i should sleep
]
C[integer: yeah gg etc
]
C[paintcan: 2:40 am
]
C[integer: i've been here since 2 am
]
C[paintcan: ,,
]
C[paintcan: you're a isck man
]
C[integer: at work i mean
]
C[integer: not working
]
C[paintcan: just
]
C[paintcan: existing
]
C[integer: i have like 28 hr days normally
]
C[paintcan: waiting for
]
C[integer: when it's not attenuated by drugs or shortened by depression
]
C[paintcan: you mena
]
C[paintcan: 28 hour days
]
C[paintcan: healthy ones?
]
C[integer: ye
]
C[integer: since i was a kid
]
C[paintcan: thats pretty unusual
]
C[integer: one week sleep at day after school
]
C[integer: then a week sleep at night
]
C[integer: tried everything
]
C[integer: but just could. not. deal
]
C[integer: with 24 hour day
]
C[paintcan: just part of normal human variance i guess
]
C[paintcan: i wish i had that excuse but for me
]
C[paintcan: its just computers
]
C[paintcan: computers helping me ruin my life
]
C[paintcan: good nite
]
C[integer: computers are the futur
