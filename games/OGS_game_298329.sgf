C[Uberdude: The shape is rather odd. Would rather not d2 to keep corner open if j4. j3 is indeed too flat, but I think h4 would be better even though it does leave k3 invasion.

C[Uberdude: Was a hard choice, and I think probably wrong. But if I d13 to grow the top then black likely gets c8 which is annoying on corner as black already got d2 c3 exchange so I can't answer at d2. But this also makes my c3 unnecessary....

C[Uberdude: Seems a bit much. f15 g15 then m17? But maybe f15 is thank you move. Could e16 too to make solid shape. But seeing as you have d7 plus d9, that group's not so weak.

C[Uberdude: Still can't decide if I should f16. Sealing you in and connecting is huge, but so is cut. But then again if black comes out it damages f13 group and shape is not great.

C[Uberdude: I thought you would answer. Maybe I should h3 instead.
]
;B[ie]
C[Uberdude: Maybe l18 to biggify the ko so you can win it in style. Rather submissive to win it by connecting. I probably ignore your threat like r8/d5 though. Maybe c17 is a local threat, but once w wins ko it looks like w e18 has ko connection so black only get b15 stones, e17 still dies.
]
C[gojohn: I was afraid that the ko becomes too big. and didn't want it affect c4 group. r8?
I thought its not big enough.

C[Uberdude: I didn't want to L18 even though it is sente as your answer at e18 makes b14 sente.

C[Uberdude: It is big, but makes j17 wasted move.
]
C[gojohn: Right. But it looked too big to miss. c14 group can live I thought.

C[gojohn: i thoght you would finish the ko here. a15 then black a13 or b12. a13 is safe but i thought one move behind. Then you move b12. i was rather thankful.
]
C[Uberdude: Yeah, a15 felt like an admission of defeat so I kept fighting the ko. But you have too many threats so if you a13 it is a lot better territory for me than the game. I worried you take at b12, I a10, and then maybe you tenuki as still a ko. Once I am alive f16 is no longer a threat.

C[Uberdude: Should d10 threat first: after I have captured it's not a threat.

C[Uberdude: Yeah you have this reduction, but white still gets a fair bit in centre, and r12 is big too.

C[gojohn: Hard to choose. I tried to find the way of some threat for k15/16 to erase center territory.

C[Uberdude: Why not m9? With the q14 weakness my reading was I can't kill n10 with m10 cut, so have to n11 compromise.
]
C[gojohn: My biggest mistake in this game. I tried to remove the J6 cut threat.
]
C[Uberdude: Yes, there was some aji there, but after m9 you will get sente as I want to keep the upper centre territory and could play a move around f7 which patches up j6 and builds a few points too. But I wasn't sure j6 even cut, but certainly some aji to reduce that area to dame if you don't defend.
