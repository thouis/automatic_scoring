C[FullTatan: ok
]

C[FullTatan: thanks
]
;B[rs]
;W[im]
;B[il]
C[qiuzhihaoyue: definitely w
]
C[nrahoubr: yeah i thought so
]
C[ObieTwice: np, Full. I assume you meant for B... look at W's second move options in the sequence
]
C[qiuzhihaoyue: Mikasa to conservative in this game
]
C[qiuzhihaoyue: W C17 and win
]
C[nrahoubr: if b didnt lose the bottom-right corner, would she win?
]
;W[km]
C[FullTatan: yes for black
]
C[Ziltch: I prob wont understnad any of this oO
]
;B[es]
;W[fs]
;B[ds]
C[qiuzhihaoyue: Mikasa will play C17
]
;W[fr]
;B[id]
;W[ic]
;B[gj]
C[nrahoubr: doesnt H18 kill w?
]
C[ObieTwice: C18 could live, ya? c17 won't though, will it?
]
;W[lm]
C[ObieTwice: or is there a weakness for W i am not seeing there?
]
C[qiuzhihaoyue: because Mikasa no other chance
]
C[ObieTwice: oh.. you mean because the try is mandatory? not because it's a great option?
]
C[qiuzhihaoyue: yes
]
;B[mm]
C[nrahoubr: can someone tell me why black doesnt play h18?
]
;W[ll]
;B[lk]
;W[nk]
;B[mk]
;W[jl]
;B[kk]
C[VincentCB: h18 doesn't work. From move 164: H18 G18 J19 J18 
]
C[ObieTwice: 4 liberties for white K18 group... h17 is dead. no need to throw another prisoner at it
]
;W[ik]
C[vwhite: The big white group have four liberties. I think white can kill the j17 group
]
C[Ziltch: If I where to guess it would be because white basically owns the territory around it so it would end up dying anyways
]
;B[lo]
;W[lp]
;B[hl]
C[vwhite: h17 i meant
]
C[nrahoubr: nevermind, i didnt saw that l 16 and l 15 were still open..
]
C[nrahoubr: ...
]
C[qiuzhihaoyue: Mikasa is not in her style in this game
]
;W[kp]
C[Ziltch: 6.5 komi is the standard btw?
]
C[vwhite: I think it is for japanese rules
]
C[VincentCB: yes
]
C[nrahoubr: it differs per country
]
C[Ziltch: Ah, then some of the info I got is a bit old I guess
]
C[Krownyh: It used to be 5.5 i believe
]
C[nrahoubr: in europe its less because the players are not as good as the japanese for example
]
C[Ziltch: yeah, thts what I knew
]
C[ObieTwice: then it should be 0.25 in the USA :)
]
C[Krownyh: LoL
]
C[Ziltch: xD
]
C[nrahoubr: =\]
]
C[qiuzhihaoyue: C17 Mikasa
]
C[vwhite: In chinese and aga rules it is 7.5 and in ING rules it is 8
]
C[Krownyh: Can black make a second eye(center group)?
]
C[ObieTwice: the pest in me would try d18, qiuz...
]
C[VincentCB: d18 not very promising.... From move 174: D18 C17 
]
C[Ziltch: C17 is better I think, but D18 is easier though that's how I see it though
]
C[vwhite: can't black connect the center to the left?
]
C[qiuzhihaoyue: i feel something at C17
]
C[nrahoubr: vwhite, is kinda connected
]
C[vwhite: ok
]
C[ObieTwice: idk.... From move 174: D18 C17 G18 F18 F19 H18 C18 
]
C[ObieTwice: was thinking of making the k17 gorup uncomfortable
]
C[qiuzhihaoyue: what is this Obie
]
;B[jk]
C[Mikasa: Sorry I had to go AFK
]
C[ObieTwice: make white choose between death to k17 and black life... prob desperate
]
C[ObieTwice: and prob wouldn't work... but was my thinking
]
;W[gk]
;B[jm]
C[DeathTheKid101: d1. From move 174: C16 C17 B16 B15 C13 A16 B17 J4 
]
C[DeathTheKid101: d2. From move 174: C16 C17 B16 B15 C13 A16 B17 J4

;W[hi]
;B[hj]
;W[fd]
C[qiuzhihaoyue: ok
]
C[DeathTheKid101: ill be careful from now on
]
;B[eg]
C[ObieTwice: i agree to make life in a vacuum, c17 is most promising. but d18 looked fun... i think white f16 ruined that fun. there was prob nothing there anyway
]
C[nrahoubr: E15 for white?
]
;W[co]
;B[bo]
;W[ee]
;B[ef]

;B[al]
C[nrahoubr: yes it is
]
;W[bk]
;B[ak]
C[Ziltch: but black on E9, wouldn't that result in her nabbing the territory within? 
]

C[Ziltch: ah
