C[paintcan: good game
]
C[paintcan: thought it was close in my favor, but no ;p
]
C[paintcan: oh wait
]
C[paintcan: G19!
]
C[Basicpract: Oh!
]
C[Basicpract: can we undo?
]
C[paintcan: i'm asking in the chat
]
C[Basicpract: ok
]
C[paintcan: sorry :x
]
C[Basicpract: it is a weird marking system
]
C[Basicpract: captured stones look like marked stones
]
C[paintcan: really good for a browser goban
]
C[Basicpract: I guess. But that is very confusing :)
]
C[paintcan: didn't mark G19 and H18 as dead by accident
]
C[Basicpract: We missed G19
]
C[Basicpract: Aww :(
]
C[paintcan: i think matburt could undo it
]
C[paintcan: but he's not online right now
]
C[Basicpract: Who is matburt
]
C[paintcan: he is one of the main authors of the site
]
C[Basicpract: Ah
]
C[paintcan: he has the power to undo pretty much anything
]
C[Basicpract: ^_^
]
C[paintcan: alright, i'll leave him a message
]
C[paintcan: how can i find his profile to message?
]
C[paintcan: oh, he's in the main chat
]
C[paintcan: thanks satomi
]
C[Basicpract: Well, I am sorry that I won by accident. I forgot to take komi into account when counting, so the score looked right :P
]
C[paintcan: i thought the score looked in hte right ballpark too
]
C[paintcan: and i'm a bit sleepy
]
C[Basicpract: :(
]
C[paintcan: ah well
]
C[paintcan: nope
]
C[paintcan: i've never tried it
]
C[Basicpract: No. This is my first game on the server, and I do not know all the features
]
C[paintcan: i just forgot about G19 and H18
]
C[paintcan: didn't see it
]
C[Basicpract: and how to do this?
]
C[paintcan: yeah, it'll be unranked
]
C[Basicpract: ahh :P
]
C[paintcan: the game is over, the only diffence those point smake
]
C[paintcan: is rating points
]
C[paintcan: so it's ok if nothing can be done
]
C[Basicpract: ok, if you want the satisfaction :P
]
C[paintcan: the game was enjoyable
]
C[paintcan: and i got lucky in the yose
]
C[paintcan: it didn't feel like a win to the point that i feel overly cheated
]
C[paintcan: by this oversight
]
C[Basicpract: :) That would be fine :)
]
C[paintcan: this was a tough game
]
C[Basicpract: ok :)
]
C[Satomi: oyoyoy
]
C[Satomi: what have happened?
]
C[Satomi: ohhh
]
C[Satomi: but it cannot be undo anymore
]
C[Satomi: as the game was already counted
]
C[Satomi: :(
]
C[Satomi: no i think not
]
C[Satomi: the one of the devs here
]
C[Satomi: haha
]
C[Satomi: you can message matburt about this through the private chat
]
C[Satomi: he might still be awake doing coding
]
C[matburt: Hey guys
]
C[matburt: sorry... once you finish a game that's it
]
C[Satomi: see
]
C[Satomi: :(
]
C[Satomi: too bad
]
C[matburt: Did you use the auto scorer?
]
C[matburt: If you are having trouble scoring games give that a shot... it works well most of the time
]
C[matburt: fyi though... you can dupliate the last move of the game into a new game and go through stone removal again if you want
]
C[Satomi: haha
]
C[Satomi: that would be interesting
]
C[matburt: There's a link to the left of the board labeled 'play from this point'
]
C[Satomi: make a new game but do the same moves
]
C[matburt: it looks like a fork/diverging lines icon
]
C[Satomi: copy every move
]
C[matburt: just mouse over them and it will pop up a tooltip
]
C[Satomi: but matburt wasn't it unranked in that one?
]
C[Satomi: i have tried it many times and it was unranked
]
C[matburt: Yep iirc... keeps people from trying to perform any trickery with really quick ranked games
]
C[Satomi: well if they don't mind :D
]
C[matburt: at some point I think we'd like to have a way to undo things but finished games are in a pretty final state in our game play database
]
C[matburt: If you want I can roll back the rating change though
]
C[matburt: Okay... I've done that.  Note that in this case Basicpract only your rating changed because you are provisional.
